The script basically allows one person to takeoff or land on a runway at once. If you dont follow that, you get shot down. It also adds some other useful things for flying such as listing all places to land, allows you to plot waypoints to runways or airports, and commands for organising flying groups and airtrips.

All commands are now in menus accessable with the numbers 4 (Main Menu) and 5 (Groups Menu).
To request things, select an airport or runway then in the dropdown box, select an option.
To add groups, type the name of it in the text box then click the add group button. To remove a group, type the name of it or select it then click delete group. To join or leave a group, click the group or type the name then click the appropriate button.

There is more detailed help in the help menu.

IMPORTANT: You can add admins by going to the server lua file then adding admin steam id's to the table.
The only thing admins can do is open any runway. Useful if someone refuses to open it after a landing or takeoff.
