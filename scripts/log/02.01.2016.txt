[ 15:09:48 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: Very true. Due to this, the PDF will have to go through massive reformations.
[ 15:10:06 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: But we will make sure that these reformations only effect the public's safety, and not their freedoms.
[ 15:10:12 ] - Obamallama: lukivica are you gonna land or not?
[ 15:10:21 ] - [Heisters.net] lkaas: The Citizens of Panau and the whole world are very worried. Will you be tackling this situation alone or working with other countries?
[ 15:10:25 ] - Lukovica: yes
[ 15:10:31 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: The number of people survived greatly outnumber the victims. This is a sign that we are doing our job.
[ 15:10:40 ] - [PDF Soldier] Rph: indeed
[ 15:10:53 ] - [Heisters.net] lkaas: Or even private military/security companies?
[ 15:10:55 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: If it weren't for us, the death toll of 1000 would've surpassed the death toll of 9/11, a few decades ago.
[ 15:11:13 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: We will be working with private military companies to make sure that attacks like this to not occur again.

[ 15:11:37 ] - Thasarion: coming th MHC
[ 15:12:10 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: We were prepared for this. That's why the death toll is thousands, not tens of thousands.
[ 15:12:17 ] - Cpt. Wilco: zeph get on
[ 15:12:27 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: We scrambled Harrier jets faster than eggs.
[ 15:12:37 ] - [Heisters.net] lkaas: Some have criticised the PAFs lack of all weather fighters as an issue
[ 15:12:37 ] - Obamallama: HSAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
[ 15:12:57 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: Yes, we were unable to scramble G9 fighters, but the harriers did the job.

[ 15:19:21 ] - [PDF Soldier] Inte: our operations
[ 15:19:28 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: Panau will have to respect the fact that, for their own safety, they'll have to sacrifice this small ammount of freedom.
