[ 16:02:47 ] - Wham!: Hello
[ 16:03:28 ] - Wham!: Rph 
[ 16:03:29 ] - Wham!: ;D
[ 16:03:31 ] - Rph: yes
[ 16:03:37 ] - Wham!: How Are You
[ 16:03:41 ] - Rph: good
[ 16:03:52 ] - Rph: i am getting sushi in like 10 minutes
[ 16:04:01 ] - Wham!: Okay
[ 16:04:23 ] - megacheezex: rl
[ 16:05:31 ] - Wham!: The winds are very strong
[ 16:05:42 ] - Wham!: 16 Knots
[ 16:05:44 ] - Rph: in what area?
[ 16:05:53 ] - Wham!: Every area
[ 16:06:00 ] - Rph: oh
[ 16:06:03 ] - Wham!: Due to clouds of course
[ 16:06:12 ] - Wham!: That's Why I am flying so low
[ 16:06:24 ] - Rph: i think higher is better
[ 16:06:30 ] - Rph: i mean higher is less wind
[ 16:06:33 ] - Wham!: Nah
[ 16:06:37 ] - Wham!: Opposite
[ 16:06:51 ] - Wham!: Higher has alot more wind
[ 16:06:55 ] - Rph: i will have to take a peak at turbulence script
[ 16:07:15 ] - Wham!: Change winds
[ 16:07:23 ] - Rph: why?
[ 16:07:28 ] - Wham!: For example storm 18 knots
[ 16:07:37 ] - Wham!: Cloudy 10 knots?
[ 16:07:39 ] - Wham!: Maybe?
[ 16:07:44 ] - Rph: poeple asked to make them even figher
[ 16:07:45 ] - Wham!: If you are allowed
[ 16:07:48 ] - Rph: higher*
[ 16:07:55 ] - MERTLEDİNİC#RUSSİKEN: sa
[ 16:07:59 ] - Wham!: Higher makes it impossible to fly the HondaJet and other airplanes
[ 16:08:17 ] - Wham!: 28 is enough for Aeroliner to not fly good
[ 16:08:34 ] - Rph: i had idea to make a script for economy update that allows you to "cut down" trees at PIA
[ 16:08:40 ] - Wham!: YES!
[ 16:08:42 ] - Wham!: Do it
[ 16:08:43 ] - Rph: by turning their hitboxes off for 30 seconds
[ 16:08:51 ] - Wham!: Nice
[ 16:09:02 ] - Wham!: Would be great if all trees covering runway and PIA got removed
[ 16:09:03 ] - Rph: ill ask tally what he thinks about it
[ 16:09:21 ] - Wham!: Would be perfect
[ 16:09:28 ] - Wham!: Finally will look like a real life
[ 16:09:33 ] - Wham!: Airport
[ 16:09:48 ] - Rph: it would stilll have trees but with hitboxes off
[ 16:10:03 ] - JIM JIM: i had my chat turned off and i didnt know how to turn it on
[ 16:10:04 ] - Wham!: Nah worthless then sadly ;P
[ 16:10:13 ] - Wham!: JUMP
[ 16:10:27 ] - Wham!: Strong Wind Makes HondaJet Crash
[ 16:10:33 ] - Rph: ik
[ 16:10:45 ] - Wham!: JIM JIM Warp
[ 16:11:41 ] - Wham!: Even though Pell is smaller it seems to fly easier in turbulence than the HondaJet
[ 16:12:07 ] - JIM JIM: is it faster?
[ 16:12:18 ] - Rph: peel
[ 16:12:30 ] - Rph: i thikn
[ 16:12:35 ] - Wham!: Yes Pell
[ 16:12:39 ] - Wham!: I Think Too
[ 16:12:51 ] - JIM JIM: ok
[ 16:13:26 ] - JIM JIM: pell is my favourite plane
[ 16:13:32 ] - Rph: mine too
[ 16:13:41 ] - JIM JIM: its so easy to control
[ 16:14:15 ] - Wham!: We will climb as high as we can
[ 16:14:19 ] - Wham!: But not to 5000
[ 16:14:56 ] - JIM JIM: i have to go
[ 16:15:01 ] - Wham!: Cya!
[ 16:15:03 ] - Wham!: ;D
[ 16:15:06 ] - Rph: cya
[ 16:15:52 ] - Rph: F33 is almost not affected by wind
[ 16:16:05 ] - Wham!: Panau News: AA100 Had An Incredibly High Climb Rate It Was 5000 And Crashed Onto Ground After Stalling At 120 Knots
[ 16:17:29 ] - Wham!: ;D
[ 16:17:31 ] - Rph: wham i have idea
[ 16:17:33 ] - Wham!: Yes
[ 16:17:38 ] - Rph: after you recover

[ 16:18:05 ] - Rph: my idae is to try in-air refuel
[ 16:18:25 ] - Wham!: Won't work
[ 16:18:34 ] - Rph: you have to stunt jump to siphon
[ 16:18:51 ] - Wham!: After you get on your own airplane it will crash if you are on the roof
[ 16:18:58 ] - Rph: oh
[ 16:19:02 ] - Wham!: And re-fuelling with siphon won't work when inside ;P
[ 16:19:13 ] - Wham!: ;D
[ 16:19:36 ] - Wham!: Finally Day Is Coming In JC2
