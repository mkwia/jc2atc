[ 02:18:02 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: Hey Neo, what'd he do
[ 02:18:04 ] - [FlyStark] Neo: He has no place here
[ 02:18:11 ] - [FlyStark] Neo: Launching boats and ramming me at PIA
[ 02:18:11 ] - JosephV001: hi

[ 02:18:36 ] - [PDF Major] Swofty-♣: Drive walka drive
[ 02:18:43 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: If Salar doesn't want him kicked out, I'm making an executive decision.
[ 02:18:50 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: I'm tired of his shit, as I've said time and time again.
[ 02:18:51 ] - [PDF Major] Swofty-♣: Demoting Salar
[ 02:18:55 ] - [PDF Soldier] Remixx: Who are yall talking about?
[ 02:19:03 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: I can't demote salar. He's an equal.
[ 02:19:04 ] - [PDF Major] Swofty-♣: I will rightfully take his place if there is no other
[ 02:19:06 ] - [FlyStark] Neo: OR being on this server. I respect PDF for RPing the airforce and all but I'm still in favor of keeping this server a General Aviation 
[ 02:19:08 ] - [PDF Major] Swofty-♣: aw
[ 02:19:14 ] - [FlyStark] Neo: roleplay as it was intended
[ 02:19:21 ] - JosephV001: guys fuck this server you dont even care about the people who join
[ 02:19:27 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: Neo, it's far past that.
[ 02:19:34 ] - [PDF Major] Swofty-♣: Joseph we are busy about a important thing
[ 02:19:34 ] - [FlyStark] Neo: SAdly so.
[ 02:19:48 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: The PDF is a force to keep the aviation rpers safe from trolls and shit.
[ 02:19:53 ] - [PDF Major] Swofty-♣: Yeah
[ 02:19:54 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: Sadly, d0m IS a troll.
[ 02:20:03 ] - [PDF Major] Swofty-♣: and he needs out of PDF
[ 02:20:04 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: So we'll kick him out.
[ 02:20:15 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: If salar doesn't like it, Salar can kiss my ass.
[ 02:20:21 ] - [FlyStark] Neo: I think you guys let too many people in though, it's no fun when half of the server is PDF
[ 02:20:23 ] - [PDF Major] Swofty-♣: it will be put to a vote between me Walker Salar and the other members
[ 02:20:33 ] - [FlyStark] Neo: It'd be better if it was exclusive
[ 02:20:35 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: Um no. No vote. He's out.
[ 02:20:40 ] - [PDF Major] Swofty-♣: lol k
[ 02:20:44 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: What do you mean by "exclusive?

[ 02:24:14 ] - [PDF Soldier] Remixx: Ok, Ive only done that once
[ 02:24:20 ] - [PDF Major] Swofty-♣: plus I was out of fuel
[ 02:24:31 ] - [FlyStark] Neo: Just being shitty pilots in general too I guess,

[ 12:32:11 ] - RammGamer: Exactly
[ 12:32:27 ] - Abstract17: Very well
[ 12:32:39 ] - Abstract17: But there is a brief test you must take.
[ 12:32:54 ] - RammGamer: sure
[ 12:32:58 ] - Abstract17: And you need to be certified for any plane you fly.
[ 12:33:16 ] - Abstract17: We do offer lessons, if you're interested.
[ 12:33:22 ] - Abstract17: Meet me at PIA
[ 12:33:36 ] - RammGamer: Ok,where exactly?
[ 12:34:06 ] - [PDF Leader] salar29: I would be interested in asking you some questions as a pilot for NK myself, may I, Abstract17?
[ 12:34:15 ] - Abstract17: We currently fly Aeroliners, Airhawks, and Cassiuses. Which would you like.
[ 12:34:24 ] - Abstract17: Ok salar
[ 12:34:26 ] - RammGamer: Aerolines
[ 12:34:40 ] - [PDF Leader] salar29: The first thing I want to know is if  you use autopilot
[ 12:34:42 ] - Abstract17: Right this way
[ 12:34:50 ] - [PDF Leader] salar29: In any time of a flight
[ 12:34:54 ] - Abstract17: We do not use autopilot
[ 12:34:58 ] - Abstract17: Ever
[ 12:35:00 ] - [PDF Leader] salar29: Never?
[ 12:35:06 ] - Abstract17: Never.
[ 12:35:06 ] - [PDF Leader] salar29: Interesting
[ 12:35:11 ] - [PDF Leader] salar29: Why not?
[ 12:35:17 ] - Abstract17: Ramm, spawn an Aeroliner
[ 12:35:45 ] - Abstract17: 1. LAndings are precise, but very shabby on the approach, and not 100% reliable
[ 12:35:56 ] - RammGamer: Sorry,game crashed
[ 12:35:58 ] - [PDF Leader] salar29: What about simply In Flight autopilot?
[ 12:36:08 ] - Abstract17: 2 It encourages pilots not to pay attention in flight
[ 12:36:19 ] - [PDF Leader] salar29: Hmmm
[ 12:36:26 ] - Abstract17: And this can be dangerous primarily due to AI air traffic
[ 12:36:39 ] - [PDF Leader] salar29: I do like your reasoning
[ 12:36:50 ] - [PDF Leader] salar29: Secondly, what aircraft do you fly best?
[ 12:36:59 ] - Abstract17: Me?
[ 12:37:08 ] - [PDF Leader] salar29: Yes indeed
[ 12:37:23 ] - Abstract17: Ramm, your first task is to fly us to DAP1
[ 12:37:52 ] - Abstract17: Well, I'm pretty good at all of them, but I guess I'm best at flying Cassiuses.
[ 12:38:04 ] - Abstract17: Airhawks for personal use
[ 12:38:54 ] - [PDF Leader] salar29: And Aeroliners?
[ 12:39:06 ] - Abstract17: I'm good at aeroliners
[ 12:39:14 ] - [PDF Leader] salar29: Cassiuses are well known for how hard they are to land
[ 12:39:25 ] - Abstract17: Hard to land?
[ 12:39:33 ] - [PDF Leader] salar29: Yes
[ 12:39:41 ] - Abstract17: I alway thought they were the easiest.
[ 12:39:43 ] - [PDF Leader] salar29: Even auto approach fucks up
[ 12:40:08 ] - Abstract17: And they can take a good beating
[ 12:40:19 ] - [PDF Leader] salar29: When you hit the ground, you have to be extremely correct and delicate
[ 12:40:25 ] - Abstract17: Usually you can safely crash land one at around 130kmh
[ 12:40:45 ] - Abstract17: Ramm, fly us to DAP1 in an Aeroliner
[ 12:41:07 ] - alepeteporico: fualanas
[ 12:41:15 ] - Abstract17: The amount of dcs
[ 12:41:17 ] - [PDF Leader] salar29: Who needs a flights?

[ 12:42:03 ] - [PDF Leader] salar29: Well, I just work as a pilot but what would you like to know?
[ 12:42:22 ] - Abstract17: How many members does it have?
[ 12:42:26 ] - [PDF Leader] salar29: Quite a lot
[ 12:42:38 ] - [PDF Leader] salar29: What is the full name of your airline?
[ 12:42:58 ] - Abstract17: Abstract Shuttle
[ 12:43:05 ] - RammGamer: Smth is wrong with my internet connection... may i pass the test later?
[ 12:43:07 ] - [PDF Leader] salar29: How many pilots does it have?
[ 12:43:12 ] - Abstract17: Or it may have changed, lemme check
[ 12:43:30 ] - [PDF Leader] salar29: Wham! said he was gonna change it 
[ 12:43:38 ] - Abstract17: We have 20 pilots and 1 pilot in training
[ 12:43:43 ] - [PDF Leader] salar29: Dayum
[ 12:44:04 ] - Abstract17: We have a steam group, too.
[ 12:44:10 ] - [PDF Leader] salar29: But I honestly haven't seen anyone but you and Wham! piloting for Abstract Shuttle in the last 2 weeks
[ 12:44:27 ] - Abstract17: Yeah, the pilots haven't been terribly active recently.
[ 12:44:32 ] - [PDF Leader] salar29: We have a website, that currently isn't up to date with all pilots but you can schedule a flight there
[ 12:44:40 ] - Abstract17: But we're always open to new recruits.
[ 12:44:47 ] - [PDF Leader] salar29: In NK I have also been one of the only active pilots lately
[ 12:44:54 ] - Abstract17: Oh cool
[ 12:45:12 ] - Abstract17: Yeah, you have to keep a steady flow of new members
[ 12:45:12 ] - [PDF Leader] salar29: I would change to abstract shuttle if in the next few days NK is this inactive
[ 12:45:25 ] - Abstract17: And find a way to keep existing ones happy
[ 12:45:41 ] - Abstract17: I think you'd be a great addition to our team.
[ 12:45:47 ] - [PDF Leader] salar29: Thank you :)
[ 12:46:05 ] - Abstract17: We give new pilots a 50% starting commision on their earnings
[ 12:46:21 ] - [PDF Leader] salar29: As I said, if NK is inactive in the next few days then I'm probably joining
[ 12:46:31 ] - Abstract17: But skilled and experienced pilots can warn up to 80%
[ 12:46:43 ] - [PDF Leader] salar29: I am pretty skilled and experienced :P
[ 12:46:51 ] - [PDF Leader] salar29: Not great with the cassius though 
[ 12:47:04 ] - [PDF Leader] salar29: I am very skilled at the aeroliner
[ 12:47:06 ] - Abstract17: With the new currency system, I think we could see some pretty cool stuff from these airlines.
[ 12:47:28 ] - Abstract17: We do offer training courses if you're interested.
[ 12:47:34 ] - [PDF Leader] salar29: Oooh
[ 12:47:39 ] - [PDF Leader] salar29: For the cassius I would like
[ 12:47:49 ] - [PDF Leader] salar29: But me as co-pilot or following you?
[ 12:47:54 ] - Abstract17: When would you like to do it?
[ 12:48:04 ] - Abstract17: I would walk you through
[ 12:48:12 ] - Abstract17: And then you would take a test
[ 12:48:15 ] - [PDF Leader] salar29: Oh
[ 12:48:33 ] - [PDF Leader] salar29: Could I have a short landing walkthrough? for the Cassius?
[ 12:48:37 ] - Всемогущий Корен: всем привет
