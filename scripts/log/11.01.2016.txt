[ 02:58:32 ] - [PDF Airman] xKamz: Great. You?
[ 02:58:40 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: Nope. Which is why we're using a VTOL.
[ 02:58:46 ] - [PDF Airman] xKamz: Ahh.
[ 02:58:49 ] - musichead28: pretty good just got off work what are you guys doing

[ 03:00:16 ] - [PDF Airman] xKamz: Is... that a cannon..?
[ 03:00:24 ] - [PDF Airman] xKamz: Omg! a trolly cart thing!
[ 03:00:29 ] - [PDF Airman] xKamz: What in the hell is this place.

[ 03:02:01 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: Grav, warp to me.
[ 03:02:03 ] - [PDF Airman] xKamz: This is where me and my ex hid a couple days ago!
[ 03:02:23 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: No, Musichead.
[ 03:02:28 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: This is PDF only.
[ 03:02:49 ] - [PDF Airman] xKamz: How do we get out of here?
[ 03:03:04 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: This was originally Baby Panay's safe house in the game.
[ 03:03:07 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: You don't get out of here.
[ 03:03:14 ] - [PDF Airman] xKamz: I've never played the storyline.
[ 03:03:15 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: Except for warping, of course.
[ 03:03:20 ] - [PDF Airman] xKamz: Don't even know who Baby Panay is.
[ 03:03:26 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: Zero Gravity, do you copy?
[ 03:03:45 ] - [FlyStark] Zero Grav: WAT?
[ 03:03:48 ] - [FlyStark] Zero Grav: Wat?
[ 03:03:54 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: Warp to me.
[ 03:04:00 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: I don't know if you've ever seen this place.
[ 03:04:03 ] - [PDF Airman] xKamz: Warp to me.
[ 03:04:09 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: This is Selatan territory.
[ 03:04:21 ] - [PDF Airman] xKamz: Is Selatan owned by the PDF?
[ 03:04:33 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: No. Selatan is owned by the country of Selatan.
[ 03:04:37 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: It's an actual faction.
[ 03:04:40 ] - [PDF Airman] xKamz: Ahhh.
[ 03:04:42 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: A PDF ally and asset.
[ 03:04:44 ] - [PDF Airman] xKamz: I've never seen them on.
[ 03:04:52 ] - [PDF Airman] xKamz: Where's the undergroind part?
[ 03:04:52 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: Have you ever met Chairman Kage?
[ 03:04:58 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: This is the underground part.
[ 03:05:02 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: We're under a massive dome.
[ 03:05:02 ] - [PDF Airman] xKamz: Ahh.
[ 03:05:13 ] - [PDF Airman] xKamz: I meant actual underground pieces xD.
[ 03:05:17 ] - [PDF Airman] xKamz: Like inside of a mountain or something.
[ 03:05:23 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: Oh.
[ 03:05:45 ] - [PDF Airman] xKamz: Does this open?
[ 03:05:45 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: LIke it here, Zero?
[ 03:05:49 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: No.

[ 03:05:57 ] - [FlyStark] Zero Grav: Been here a million times.
[ 03:05:59 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: It's a massive indestructable dome.
[ 03:06:05 ] - [PDF Airman] xKamz: I meant this mouth thing.
[ 03:06:08 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: Oh.
[ 03:06:10 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: Not really
[ 03:06:14 ] - [PDF Airman] xKamz: There's a computer.
[ 03:06:15 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: Gotta glitch in.
[ 03:06:23 ] - [PDF Airman] xKamz: What's inside?
[ 03:06:29 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: This area.
[ 03:06:39 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: The dome is what the mouth leads to.
[ 03:06:48 ] - [PDF Airman] xKamz: Ahhh.
[ 03:07:11 ] - [PDF Airman] xKamz: Here I go!
[ 03:07:22 ] - [PDF Airman] xKamz: This is awesome.

[ 03:08:17 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: This is our secondary base, our main one being MHC.
[ 03:08:19 ] - [PDF Airman] xKamz: I should play the storyline.
[ 03:08:31 ] - [PDF Airman] xKamz: What about LOST island?
[ 03:08:45 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: Zombies in the storyline.

[ 03:14:38 ] - musichead28: why did I warp
[ 03:14:47 ] - [PDF Airman] xKamz: I just accepted Musics warp by accident :/
[ 03:15:43 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: Anyone who goes to our base that's not PDF and that's not Musichead is signing their own death warrent
[ 03:15:56 ] - musichead28: oh
[ 03:16:19 ] - musichead28: just asking how do you own certain spots
[ 03:16:28 ] - musichead28: of an open world game
[ 03:16:49 ] - [PDF Airman] xKamz: You claim them under a Faction.
[ 03:16:59 ] - musichead28: but how
[ 03:17:09 ] - [PDF Airman] xKamz: If it isn't claimed, you say you want it and take it.
[ 03:17:11 ] - [PDF Airman] xKamz: Simple.
[ 03:17:12 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: By saying "We now own __________"
[ 03:17:16 ] - [PDF Airman] xKamz: ^
[ 03:17:21 ] - [PDF Airman] xKamz: I now own both mountains.
[ 03:17:23 ] - [PDF Airman] xKamz: See?
[ 03:17:24 ] - [PDF Airman] xKamz: Easy.
[ 03:17:29 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: Also, adding "If you want it, kiss my ass" is optional
[ 03:17:38 ] - musichead28: lmao naw
[ 03:18:15 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: Wtf, that gun works!?
[ 03:18:19 ] - [PDF Airman] xKamz: What?
[ 03:18:29 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: Fuck yeah!!!
[ 03:19:18 ] - [PDF Airman] xKamz: How in the fuck?
[ 03:19:26 ] - [PDF Airman] xKamz: Ow.
[ 03:19:28 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: Lol...
[ 03:19:33 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: The game just aims at random targets.
[ 03:19:36 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: What the fuck??
[ 03:19:48 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: It's shooting at me
[ 03:19:55 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: Kill the gun!!!
[ 03:19:57 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: Kill it!!!
[ 03:20:07 ] - musichead28: thats grand old chap
[ 03:20:36 ] - [PDF Airman] xKamz: How'd you enable it?!
[ 03:20:43 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: Idek
[ 03:21:16 ] - [PDF Airman] xKamz: It stopped!
[ 03:21:27 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: Son of a bitch!
[ 03:21:35 ] - musichead28: who me?
[ 03:21:39 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: I wonder if..
[ 03:21:43 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: This could work as air defence.
[ 03:21:48 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: I'm gonna come in with a helicopter.
[ 03:21:55 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: This might kill me
[ 03:22:04 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: But it's for science!
[ 03:22:20 ] - [PDF Airman] xKamz: Lmfao
[ 03:22:23 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: Holy shit
[ 03:22:23 ] - [PDF Airman] xKamz: You got rekt.
[ 03:22:30 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: It just shot down my chopper.
[ 03:22:31 ] - [PDF Airman] xKamz: This cannon doesn't take shit.
[ 03:22:33 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: Do you know what this means??
[ 03:22:38 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: This is our safe zone!!!
[ 03:23:00 ] - [PDF Airman] xKamz: Yes, but not even the PDF can have vehicles then.
[ 03:23:05 ] - [PDF Airman] xKamz: That'd kinda suck.
[ 03:23:51 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: We'd just approach the area from another direction.
[ 03:23:56 ] - [PDF Airman] xKamz: True.
[ 03:23:58 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: Enemies attacking us wouldn't know.
[ 03:24:10 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: We'd be able to hide under that dome, and they wouldn't be able to hit us from the air.
[ 03:24:18 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: And we'd be able to repel a foot attack.
[ 03:24:20 ] - [PDF Airman] xKamz: Ima test a few things.
[ 03:24:26 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: K.
[ 03:24:29 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: Ok.
[ 03:24:32 ] - [PDF Airman] xKamz: It's directional.
[ 03:24:36 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: Duh.

[ 07:12:51 ] - [FlyStark] Zero Grav: Way too high.
[ 07:12:57 ] - Vanillabubbles: the ground here is pretty uneven too 
[ 07:13:00 ] - [FlyStark] Zero Grav: Went of the runway.
[ 07:13:13 ] - Vanillabubbles: tcompounded witht the lightness of this plane

[ 08:34:38 ] - [PDF Airman] xKamz: Oh true xD.
[ 08:34:59 ] - [PDF Airman] xKamz: What's the point in having trees infront of the runway...
[ 08:35:02 ] - [PDF Airman] xKamz: Such a stupid idea.
[ 08:35:04 ] - [FlyStark] Zero Grav: Ikr.
[ 08:35:10 ] - [FlyStark] Zero Grav: They should have chopped them down.
[ 08:35:13 ] - [PDF Airman] xKamz: ^^
[ 08:35:19 ] - [PDF Airman] xKamz: That's what Razorbacks are for tho.
[ 08:35:23 ] - [FlyStark] Zero Grav: When they made the flppin airfield
[ 08:36:06 ] - [PDF Airman] xKamz: Such a strange runway xD.
[ 08:36:10 ] - [PDF Airman] xKamz: It's so tiny + trees everywhere.
[ 08:36:21 ] - [PDF Airman] xKamz: That was close
[ 08:36:42 ] - [FlyStark] Zero Grav: Who the fuck parks there plane on the runway...They should get busted. 
[ 08:37:01 ] - [PDF Airman] xKamz: It's bad enough they parked a plane on the runway, but they parked THREE planes on the runway.
[ 08:37:16 ] - [PDF Airman] xKamz: 3 Freaking planes on a runway = death trap.
[ 08:37:35 ] - [FlyStark] Zero Grav: Mmmmm.
[ 08:37:43 ] - [PDF Airman] xKamz: What else have you found?

[ 08:38:47 ] - [PDF Airman] xKamz: I'm pretty sure I still own the desert.
[ 08:38:50 ] - [FlyStark] Zero Grav: Hahaha
[ 08:38:58 ] - [PDF Airman] xKamz: Or the airports atleast.
[ 08:39:12 ] - [PDF Airman] xKamz: I don't think that's a runway.
[ 08:39:27 ] - [FlyStark] Zero Grav: It is now.
[ 08:39:29 ] - [FlyStark] Zero Grav: Bitch.
[ 08:39:31 ] - [PDF Airman] xKamz: xD nice.

[ 08:39:50 ] - [FlyStark] Zero Grav: Good for our base
[ 08:40:04 ] - [PDF Airman] xKamz: It's pretty open to aerial attacks though.
[ 08:40:07 ] - [FlyStark] Zero Grav: Don't tell the PDF
[ 08:40:08 ] - [PDF Airman] xKamz: Nothing surrounding it.
