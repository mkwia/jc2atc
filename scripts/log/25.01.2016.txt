[ 17:55:48 ] - Jeremy Clarkson: heh
[ 17:55:48 ] - Wham!: Once he is online I tell him to open it.
[ 17:55:48 ] - Chairman Kage: Michael linked the test to me
[ 17:55:58 ] - Chairman Kage: So I might (hopefully) become a helper there
[ 17:56:00 ] - Wham!: Chairman Kage I give you helper instantly if you want on the new server

[ 17:56:30 ] - salar29: Wham! can you give meh mod there?
[ 17:56:31 ] - Wham!: Most likely most active staff that are staff or were staff here will get added.
[ 17:56:32 ] - salar29: :D
[ 17:56:36 ] - Wham!: Salar maybe
[ 17:56:37 ] - Chairman Kage: oh I see
[ 17:56:39 ] - Chairman Kage: Nice
[ 17:56:47 ] - Chairman Kage: Sayonara!
[ 17:56:48 ] - Jeremy Clarkson: i was a staff
[ 17:56:54 ] - salar29: No brag or anything but I think I deserve it as the most active staff
[ 17:56:56 ] - Wham!: I bet the new server will start with this amount of players after maybe a few days
[ 17:57:11 ] - Jeremy Clarkson: as awareness grows
[ 17:57:13 ] - Wham!: Yes
[ 17:57:25 ] - Wham!: PRobably more players cause I and others are announcing it
[ 17:57:34 ] - Wham!: It's called: JC2MP Faction And Economy
[ 17:57:39 ] - salar29: The name of the other server should change to ATC as well so that people can know of it
[ 17:57:39 ] - Jeremy Clarkson: panda really does hate tally and kiwi
[ 17:57:50 ] - Wham!: Economy will probably get very developed
[ 17:57:55 ] - salar29: But how did this thing with Panda start?
[ 17:57:55 ] - Wham!: And ATC
[ 17:58:08 ] - Wham!: Yes ATC Will most likely come
[ 17:58:12 ] - Wham!: IT will come
[ 17:58:18 ] - Jeremy Clarkson: he said they spammed shit on him
[ 17:58:18 ] - salar29: Yes!
[ 17:58:23 ] - salar29: Spammed wut?
[ 17:58:32 ] - Jeremy Clarkson: bad shit
[ 17:58:38 ] - Jeremy Clarkson: like insults ect
[ 17:58:39 ] - Wham!: mICHAEL IS ONLINE
[ 17:58:48 ] - salar29: But wasn't he trying to copy ATC?
[ 17:58:52 ] - Wham!: I told him to open the server
[ 17:58:52 ] - Jeremy Clarkson: he siad to stop spamming
[ 17:58:55 ] - Jeremy Clarkson: no no
[ 17:59:03 ] - Wham!: I told him to open the new server
[ 17:59:05 ] - salar29: Yai
[ 17:59:07 ] - Jeremy Clarkson: he got a file same time tally got a file
[ 17:59:13 ] - salar29: Oh
[ 17:59:18 ] - Wham!: Once the server is open expect it to be basic as it's not fully developed
[ 17:59:25 ] - salar29: Ok
[ 17:59:25 ] - Jeremy Clarkson: tally jumped to conclusions
[ 17:59:25 ] - Wham!: So ATC is without script once it comes
[ 17:59:31 ] - Wham!: It will get script soon
[ 17:59:43 ] - salar29: Can mikey change the server name?
[ 17:59:55 ] - Wham!: JEremy actually what caused that to happen
[ 17:59:58 ] - Jeremy Clarkson: also they said "stop being so anal about it, you have a script to stop spam"
[ 18:00:01 ] - Wham!: For eachother to no longer be friends
[ 18:00:19 ] - Jeremy Clarkson: he say this to me
[ 18:00:26 ] - Jeremy Clarkson: i repeat what he said

[ 19:31:22 ] - [PDF Col.] Kage: Hey hey wait wat is going on?
[ 19:31:35 ] - [PDF Owner] salar29: I don't have a problem with you being Leader and me being Owner - it's the same thing.
[ 19:32:48 ] - [PDF Major] Archkey: fml
[ 19:32:59 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: Yeah, Salar, but it's confusing as [PDF Major] Archkey F Col.] Kage DecoratorBog [ITA]  [ITA] ratorBog [ITA] F Major] Archkey DF Major] Archkey PDF Major] Archkey PDF Major] Arcam! am! m!

[ 19:33:12 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: I don't know what just happened.
[ 19:33:16 ] - [PDF Owner] salar29: If you call that ''lack of coordination'' then you don't know what lack of coordination is.
[ 19:33:24 ] - [PDF Owner] salar29: What the fuck, Walker?
[ 19:33:33 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: I dunno..
[ 19:33:50 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: But Salar, you're barely on, and when you do you're more concerend about your helper rank.
[ 19:33:59 ] - [PDF Owner] salar29: Barely on?
[ 19:34:00 ] - [PDF Leader] xKamz: ^^
[ 19:34:04 ] - [PDF Owner] salar29: Barely fucking on?
[ 19:34:04 ] - [PDF Leader] xKamz: You've changed since you were promoted.
[ 19:34:09 ] - [PDF Owner] salar29: Are you fucking kidding?
[ 19:34:22 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: You're never on during battle, and when was the last time I saw you doing some legit diplomacy?
[ 19:34:24 ] - [PDF Owner] salar29: I'm on this server pretty much all fucking day.
[ 19:34:29 ] - [PDF Col.] Kage: I have to object to that, Sal is actually on very often.
[ 19:34:35 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: When it fucking counts.
[ 19:34:36 ] - [PDF Owner] salar29: Because you're the only one who starts war, Walker.
[ 19:34:45 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: I war trolls.
[ 19:34:46 ] - [PDF Major] Archkey: Ooooh... Damn...
[ 19:34:48 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: We war trolls.
[ 19:34:49 ] - [PDF Owner] salar29: You're violent af.
[ 19:34:52 ] - [PDF Col.] Kage: We do.
[ 19:34:54 ] - [PDF Col.] Kage: We are.
[ 19:35:09 ] - [PDF Owner] salar29: Kage you do realize Colonel fits in your name right?
[ 19:35:16 ] - [PDF Col.] Kage: Hm?

[ 19:35:20 ] - [PDF Col.] Kage: Whaddya mean?
[ 19:35:23 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: He just doesn't like big names, Ig.
[ 19:35:28 ] - [PDF Col.] Kage: Oh I see

[ 19:35:37 ] - [PDF Col.] Kage: yea
[ 19:35:40 ] - [PDF Major] Archkey: Tbh, war is kinda fun,  If there wasnt war PDF wouldnt really have anything to do.
[ 19:35:44 ] - [PDF Leader] xKamz: ^^
[ 19:35:50 ] - [PDF Col.] Kage: I do actually think so too Arch
[ 19:35:52 ] - [PDF Leader] xKamz: I freaking love PvP, but not constant PvP.
[ 19:35:56 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: Exactly.
[ 19:35:57 ] - [PDF Major] Archkey: ^
[ 19:35:57 ] - [PDF Owner] salar29: PDF doesn't need to declare war do be honest.
[ 19:36:04 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: Why the hell not?
[ 19:36:06 ] - [PDF Col.] Kage: BuT THEWN
[ 19:36:09 ] - [PDF Major] Archkey: We never declare war.
[ 19:36:11 ] - [PDF Owner] salar29: War is something much bigger than these things.
[ 19:36:17 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: Wait, back on topic
[ 19:36:18 ] - [PDF Col.] Kage: what is our meaning then? Honestly.
[ 19:36:21 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: Salar, I fucking hate you.
[ 19:36:34 ] - [PDF Col.] Kage: Walker, take it easy
[ 19:36:38 ] - [PDF Owner] salar29: War is something like what happened in the old PDF.
[ 19:36:41 ] - [PDF Col.] Kage: can we solve it nice
[ 19:37:03 ] - [PDF Owner] salar29: Which caused it to... Well, to dissolve.
[ 19:37:31 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: No. That's not what caused it to dissolve.
[ 19:37:36 ] - [PDF Major] Archkey: Salar, what is PDF without war... We are a defense FORCE we fight... If we didnt have war PDF would have 6 members.
[ 19:37:37 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: Titan engaged an innocent.
[ 19:37:46 ] - [PDF Owner] salar29: Yes it is. You refuse to amit that as well, though.
[ 19:37:53 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: hazzar (old co-leader) claimed AP3.
[ 19:37:54 ] - [PDF Owner] salar29: Archkey, what you are thinking is attack.
[ 19:38:05 ] - [PDF Leader] xKamz: Salar, attacking or defending, it's still war.
[ 19:38:05 ] - [PDF Major] Archkey: What?
[ 19:38:06 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: People objected to that.
[ 19:38:07 ] - [PDF Owner] salar29: Hazzar? Oh, that cunt.
[ 19:38:09 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: Yeah.
[ 19:38:16 ] - [PDF Owner] salar29: We only attack to defend.
[ 19:38:18 ] - [PDF Leader] xKamz: In the end, we all have fun, right?
[ 19:38:21 ] - [PDF Owner] salar29: Not to attack.
[ 19:38:23 ] - [PDF Major] Archkey: Yes, we do.
[ 19:38:24 ] - [PDF Owner] salar29: Yeah, Kum!
[ 19:38:25 ] - Wham!: Helo
[ 19:38:25 ] - [PDF Col.] Kage: Right, Kamz.
[ 19:38:28 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: Hazzar killed PDF by refusing to move.
[ 19:38:31 ] - [PDF Col.] Kage: Thats the main meaning.
[ 19:38:36 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: By refusing to take in to account what other people were saying.
[ 19:38:39 ] - [PDF Owner] salar29: But Hazzar claimed war!
[ 19:38:44 ] - [PDF Owner] salar29: And that war, ended PDF!
[ 19:38:49 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: Hazzar killed the PDF by claiming AP3. Other people attacked AP3.
[ 19:38:53 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: Salar, I didn't support this.
[ 19:38:59 ] - [PDF Owner] salar29: Because Hazzar put all bases at risk!
[ 19:39:06 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: But what killed it was Titan engaging Silver because he landed at AP3.
[ 19:39:09 ] - [PDF Owner] salar29: As he was sure as fuck we would win!
[ 19:39:11 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: That was when I opened my mouth.
[ 19:39:17 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: When I opened my mouth, everyone left.
[ 19:39:21 ] - [PDF Owner] salar29: Walker, Hazzar declared war.
[ 19:39:28 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: Hazzar didn't declare war on shit.
[ 19:39:31 ] - [PDF Owner] salar29: And he put at risk everything we owned.
[ 19:39:36 ] - [PDF Owner] salar29: Yes, he fucking did.
[ 19:39:38 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: He claimed AP3 and killed everyone who landed there.
[ 19:39:42 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: That was what happened.
[ 19:39:43 ] - [PDF Owner] salar29: Against those MF idiots.
[ 19:39:45 ] - Wham!: The Splat Calculator
[ 19:39:57 ] - [PDF Owner] salar29: That, walker, THAT, lead to Hazzar declaring war.
[ 19:39:59 ] - [PDF Major] Archkey: PDF takes risks, Salar, what you are saying makes no sense to me.
[ 19:39:59 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: Salar, that isn't the conversation
[ 19:40:28 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: The conversation is that I'm tired of you being so stubborn. I'm tired of you doing sweet f.a when it comes to diplomacy.
[ 19:40:43 ] - [PDF Owner] salar29: Are you fucking asking me to be Hitler?
[ 19:40:44 ] - [PDF Col.] Kage: I must agree with the rest, but still, I don't think this is anything to fight over, we are here together because we like to play and rp
[ 19:40:52 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: I'm sick of you coming in here and telling me what should be written in the group. Telling me to change my name to some bs.
[ 19:40:56 ] - Wham!: PDF IS THE PANAU Defense Force
[ 19:41:00 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: We have something that works.
[ 19:41:05 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: Stick with it.
[ 19:41:10 ] - Wham!: They are not bad people they shall only take risk for something they want to do
[ 19:41:13 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: There's no need for MORE change! This is already more than enough!
[ 19:41:14 ] - Wham!: And if they want to help
[ 19:41:26 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: I mean, we're changing servers for fucks sake!
[ 19:41:41 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: I'm tired of your overall immature train of thought.
[ 19:41:47 ] - [PDF Major] Archkey: ^
[ 19:41:52 ] - [PDF Major] Archkey: We all are.
[ 19:41:54 ] - [PDF Cpl] \(√íœâ√ì)/: omg i didnt know walker was so cool :O

[ 19:42:33 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: We're doing that.
[ 19:42:36 ] - [PDF Leader] xKamz: The server change is a lot.
[ 19:42:38 ] - Wham!: Good
[ 19:42:44 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: If you guys had listened to me when I was talking, you'd know that.
[ 19:42:49 ] - [PDF Leader] xKamz: ^^

[ 19:46:34 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: Alright. Now that I've successfully vented, I'm now able to put up with 4 more hours worth of bullshit.

[ 19:47:20 ] - Wham!: SHALL
[ 19:47:21 ] - [PDF Owner] salar29: It should be like a maximum of 200m squared, and then you could do /claim and then the length and width and it addups to a value squared
[ 19:47:23 ] - Wham!: BE DEMOCRACY
[ 19:47:36 ] - [PDF Leader] xKamz: How about you have a claim size limit?
[ 19:47:39 ] - [PDF Leader] xKamz: Every player has 1000m cap.

[ 19:47:48 ] - [PDF Col.] Kage: hop in, waruke, desu
[ 19:47:49 ] - Wham!: Maximum of 100 meters I guess would be good
[ 19:47:50 ] - [PDF Leader] xKamz: Use all 1000m on one claim.
[ 19:47:52 ] - Wham!: I mean 1000 meters
[ 19:47:58 ] - [PDF Leader] xKamz: Or space it out.
