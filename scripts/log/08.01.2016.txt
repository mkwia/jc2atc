[ 11:01:26 ] - [PDF Leader] salar29: :(
[ 11:02:05 ] - [PDF Leader] salar29: Well, another thing is that if you type with autopilot on, one of the autopilot systems always fucks up and it's hard to roleplay the ATC

[ 11:04:11 ] - tally: stuff
[ 11:04:28 ] - [PDF Leader] salar29: Like if you're doing an action, and press T,  the action continues without you doing anything
[ 11:04:41 ] - [PDF Leader] salar29: Which can be abused sometimes but is annoying in autopilot
[ 11:05:44 ] - @Andrew#2016: lol
[ 11:05:47 ] - [PDF Leader] salar29: And when you press G to get out of a plane, it registers you on the map as still where you got into the plane in the first place, and o

[ 21:25:10 ] - -President- LAG: there are loads of people in Panau
[ 21:25:13 ] - -President- LAG: yeah
[ 21:25:21 ] - [Heisters.net] lkaas: You would have the PDF fighting you

[ 21:25:54 ] - -President- LAG: Everything that was in Panau before is still in Panau
[ 21:26:02 ] - -President- LAG: not true xKamz 
[ 21:26:07 ] - [Heisters.net] lkaas: then you wouldn't be able to wage a war if you were /passive
[ 21:26:18 ] - -President- LAG: you can get rammed and die and hit by rockets and die in passive
[ 21:26:31 ] - -President- LAG: it's not godmode exactly
[ 21:26:37 ] - [Heisters.net] lkaas: rockets affect passive?
[ 21:26:37 ] - xKamz: Wouldn't that be abuse though?
[ 21:26:42 ] - -President- LAG: nope
[ 21:26:46 ] - -President- LAG: cuz we would be at war
[ 21:26:50 ] - xKamz: Ahhh, true.
[ 21:26:52 ] - -President- LAG: so random PVP is allowed
[ 21:26:56 ] - xKamz: I'm not starting one (yet) anyways xD.
[ 21:27:01 ] - xKamz: I'd rather fight off smaller Nations
[ 21:27:03 ] - [Heisters.net] lkaas: well it's not random PVP if we are at war
[ 21:27:11 ] - [Heisters.net] lkaas: there are no smaller nations
[ 21:27:13 ] - -President- LAG: Don't start a PGP VS SHIELD war again
[ 21:27:19 ] - -President- LAG: i'm having flashbacks to that

[ 21:28:43 ] - Noel A.K.A Blue Sani: oh ok
[ 21:28:43 ] - [Heisters.net] lkaas: We have no sides, only who pays us the most
[ 21:28:50 ] - [Heisters.net] lkaas: Shield was never a legitimate thing
[ 21:28:56 ] - -President- LAG: people are free to use Panau airports
[ 21:29:01 ] - wolfie: how do you do that
[ 21:29:05 ] - [Heisters.net] lkaas: It was theft pure and simple

[ 21:29:50 ] - xKamz: Can I claim even more land?
[ 21:29:52 ] - -President- LAG: we kind of go in an arch shape
