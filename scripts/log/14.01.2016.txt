[ 04:17:25 ] - [PDF Airman] xKamz: Sorry, was watching videos.
[ 04:17:26 ] - ACLegoDude: I'm tree
[ 04:17:35 ] - [PDF Airman] xKamz: I found the perfect training route for both types of runways.
[ 04:18:43 ] - [FlyStark] Zero Grav: Let me see.
[ 04:19:00 ] - [PDF Airman] xKamz: Go from here to Kem Sungai Sejuk.
[ 04:19:09 ] - [PDF Airman] xKamz: It's a very very open path. 
[ 04:19:15 ] - [PDF Airman] xKamz: Perfect for training landing.
[ 04:19:17 ] - [FlyStark] Zero Grav: Show me.
[ 04:19:22 ] - [PDF Airman] xKamz: Drive ^
[ 04:19:32 ] - [FlyStark] Zero Grav: Get in.
[ 04:19:37 ] - [PDF Airman] xKamz: Wait
[ 04:19:37 ] - [FlyStark] Zero Grav: So it starts here?
[ 04:19:39 ] - [PDF Airman] xKamz: Need a mosue.
[ 04:20:03 ] - [PDF Airman] xKamz: Yeah
[ 04:20:07 ] - [PDF Airman] xKamz: Go from here to Kem Sungai Sejuk.
[ 04:20:09 ] - [FlyStark] Zero Grav: So from here to where?
[ 04:20:13 ] - [FlyStark] Zero Grav: Where is that?
[ 04:20:16 ] - [PDF Airman] xKamz: Hang on.
[ 04:20:27 ] - [PDF Airman] xKamz: ./sw 16782 12073
[ 04:20:34 ] - [PDF Airman] xKamz: To your right.
[ 04:22:04 ] - [PDF Airman] xKamz: Nice landing.
[ 04:22:12 ] - [FlyStark] Zero Grav: How is this a good training route?
[ 04:22:18 ] - [PDF Airman] xKamz: I said it was perfect for me.
[ 04:22:19 ] - [FlyStark] Zero Grav: This is a military airport.
[ 04:22:21 ] - [PDF Airman] xKamz: ^
[ 04:22:23 ] - [FlyStark] Zero Grav: We should be here.
[ 04:22:27 ] - [PDF Airman] xKamz: That's my whole point.
[ 04:22:36 ] - [PDF Airman] xKamz: I'm workign on my landing.
[ 04:22:51 ] - [FlyStark] Zero Grav: So you don't want me to be your instructor?
[ 04:22:54 ] - [PDF Airman] xKamz: I do.
[ 04:23:18 ] - [FlyStark] Zero Grav: You said you are working on your landings.
[ 04:23:40 ] - [PDF Airman] xKamz: I've been workign on them while you've been gone.
[ 04:23:57 ] - [FlyStark] Zero Grav: But like how is it helping when you aren't learning anything new?
[ 04:24:09 ] - [FlyStark] Zero Grav: Just doing it over and over again.
[ 04:24:18 ] - [PDF Airman] xKamz: Because I can barrely even land on this lmao.
[ 04:24:47 ] - [PDF Airman] xKamz: I've also been trying to mimic Neo's path, speed, and height.
[ 04:24:54 ] - [PDF Airman] xKamz: From the flight from earlier.
[ 04:28:03 ] - [FlyStark] Zero Grav: How did it go?
[ 04:28:07 ] - [FlyStark] Zero Grav: Was it good?
[ 04:28:17 ] - [PDF Airman] xKamz: You mean when Neo flew me?
[ 04:28:22 ] - [FlyStark] Zero Grav: Yeah.
[ 04:28:26 ] - [PDF Airman] xKamz: Yeah, it was great.
[ 04:28:29 ] - [PDF Airman] xKamz: Very very smooth.
[ 04:28:45 ] - [FlyStark] Zero Grav: He was like you when i first met him.
[ 04:28:48 ] - [FlyStark] Zero Grav: Couldn't land.
[ 04:28:50 ] - [FlyStark] Zero Grav: All floppy.
[ 04:28:52 ] - [FlyStark] Zero Grav: Exploded.
[ 04:28:55 ] - [PDF Airman] xKamz: xD
[ 04:28:56 ] - [FlyStark] Zero Grav: Etc.
[ 04:29:19 ] - [FlyStark] Zero Grav: See, you too can become that good one day.
[ 04:29:27 ] - [PDF Airman] xKamz: One day.
[ 04:29:41 ] - [PDF Airman] xKamz: Dap1 is 410 meters high right?
[ 04:29:48 ] - [FlyStark] Zero Grav: Idk
[ 04:29:52 ] - [PDF Airman] xKamz: xD
[ 04:30:04 ] - [PDF Airman] xKamz: How'd you learn to fly so well?
[ 04:30:07 ] - [FlyStark] Zero Grav: I don't fly to military airports often.
[ 04:30:17 ] - [FlyStark] Zero Grav: Well.
[ 04:30:20 ] - [FlyStark] Zero Grav: I taught myself.
[ 04:30:32 ] - [FlyStark] Zero Grav: I also applied real world knowledge.
[ 04:30:40 ] - [FlyStark] Zero Grav: From when i fly IRL.
[ 04:30:52 ] - [PDF Airman] xKamz: Ahhhhhh.
[ 04:30:54 ] - [FlyStark] Zero Grav: And from many hours of flying on JC2.
[ 04:31:03 ] - [PDF Airman] xKamz: Rea life flying experience is a huge plus.
[ 04:31:08 ] - [PDF Airman] xKamz: Real*
[ 04:31:35 ] - [PDF Airman] xKamz: What should I do to practice while you're offline?
[ 04:31:42 ] - [FlyStark] Zero Grav: Idk.
[ 04:31:49 ] - [FlyStark] Zero Grav: Just work on your landings.
[ 04:32:10 ] - [PDF Airman] xKamz: Alright.
[ 04:32:16 ] - [FlyStark] Zero Grav: I wanna see "you" land an Airhawk.
[ 04:32:24 ] - [PDF Airman] xKamz: It's very bad.
[ 04:32:30 ] - [FlyStark] Zero Grav: So, I need to see it.
[ 04:32:35 ] - [PDF Airman] xKamz: True.
[ 04:32:56 ] - [FlyStark] Zero Grav: Warp.
[ 04:33:08 ] - [PDF Airman] xKamz: 1 second, about to land.
[ 04:33:21 ] - [PDF Airman] xKamz: I don't know that airport.
[ 04:33:27 ] - [PDF Airman] xKamz: Never landed on it before.
[ 04:33:34 ] - [FlyStark] Zero Grav: Which one?
[ 04:33:38 ] - [PDF Airman] xKamz: The one you're at.
[ 04:33:45 ] - [PDF Airman] xKamz: Only taken off.
[ 04:33:45 ] - [FlyStark] Zero Grav: Well it's where I train all my students.
[ 04:33:54 ] - [PDF Airman] xKamz: I better get familiar then.
[ 04:34:44 ] - [FlyStark] Zero Grav: And remember, if the airport is busy make a traffic call.
[ 04:34:49 ] - [FlyStark] Zero Grav: For example >>>
[ 04:34:53 ] - [PDF Airman] xKamz: No one is on besides us.
[ 04:35:01 ] - [PDF Airman] xKamz: I don't know traffic calls xD.
[ 04:35:05 ] - [FlyStark] Zero Grav: I'm saying "if".
[ 04:35:10 ] - [PDF Airman] xKamz: Yeah, I know.
[ 04:35:38 ] - [FlyStark] Zero Grav: For example >> Lembah Taffic. Airhawk Wisky Tango Foxtrot is taking off straight out runway O2L VFR.
[ 04:36:00 ] - [FlyStark] Zero Grav: You get in the pilot's seat.
[ 04:36:14 ] - [PDF Airman] xKamz: Where do I go? xD
[ 04:36:25 ] - [FlyStark] Zero Grav: Get in the pilots seat.
[ 04:36:28 ] - [FlyStark] Zero Grav: The front seat.
[ 04:37:07 ] - [FlyStark] Zero Grav: Now, I want to see you taxi onto runway O2L takeoff, do a left turn come around and land back on runway O2L
[ 04:37:21 ] - [PDF Airman] xKamz: Watch me crash.
[ 04:37:25 ] - [FlyStark] Zero Grav: And remember, always fly with Jethud
[ 04:37:27 ] - [PDF Airman] xKamz: How fast do I taxi?
[ 04:37:32 ] - [PDF Airman] xKamz: Jethud is up.
[ 04:37:37 ] - [FlyStark] Zero Grav: Below 30km
[ 04:37:48 ] - [PDF Airman] xKamz: I'll just go 15...
[ 04:37:53 ] - [FlyStark] Zero Grav: kk
[ 04:38:05 ] - [PDF Airman] xKamz: Now we wait.
[ 04:38:12 ] - [PDF Airman] xKamz: Wait, this way.. .right?
[ 04:38:17 ] - [FlyStark] Zero Grav: Go.
[ 04:38:20 ] - [FlyStark] Zero Grav: Full trottle.
[ 04:38:23 ] - [FlyStark] Zero Grav: Takeoff.
[ 04:38:32 ] - [FlyStark] Zero Grav: And do what you do.
[ 04:38:35 ] - [PDF Airman] xKamz: LefT?
[ 04:38:39 ] - [FlyStark] Zero Grav: I'm watching carefully.
[ 04:38:41 ] - [FlyStark] Zero Grav: Yes
[ 04:38:50 ] - [PDF Airman] xKamz: Weee.
[ 04:39:05 ] - [PDF Airman] xKamz: (No idea where to go)
[ 04:39:14 ] - [FlyStark] Zero Grav: Land back on the runway to our left.
[ 04:39:19 ] - [FlyStark] Zero Grav: So keep going.
[ 04:39:21 ] - [PDF Airman] xKamz: I'll crash for sure xD.
[ 04:39:26 ] - [FlyStark] Zero Grav: Then turn around.
[ 04:39:38 ] - [FlyStark] Zero Grav: And be below 130km on landing.
[ 04:39:46 ] - [PDF Airman] xKamz: Oh shit.
[ 04:39:49 ] - [PDF Airman] xKamz: Map won't load.
[ 04:39:53 ] - [PDF Airman] xKamz: Where's the runway?
[ 04:39:56 ] - [PDF Airman] xKamz: Oh...
[ 04:39:59 ] - [FlyStark] Zero Grav: To our right.....
[ 04:40:03 ] - [FlyStark] Zero Grav: Are you blind?
[ 04:40:03 ] - [PDF Airman] xKamz: It wasn't there.
[ 04:40:10 ] - [PDF Airman] xKamz: My laptop takes awhile to render.
[ 04:40:36 ] - [FlyStark] Zero Grav: Too fast too high.
[ 04:40:40 ] - [FlyStark] Zero Grav: Turned too soon
[ 04:40:42 ] - [FlyStark] Zero Grav: Off center
[ 04:40:43 ] - [PDF Airman] xKamz: Bak around_
[ 04:40:45 ] - [FlyStark] Zero Grav: Not lined up.
[ 04:40:47 ] - [PDF Airman] xKamz: Ikr
[ 04:40:50 ] - [FlyStark] Zero Grav: Horrible aproach.
[ 04:41:02 ] - [PDF Airman] xKamz: xD
[ 04:41:04 ] - [PDF Airman] xKamz: Told you.
[ 04:41:36 ] - [FlyStark] Zero Grav: Way better
[ 04:41:42 ] - [PDF Airman] xKamz: Lower?
[ 04:41:45 ] - [FlyStark] Zero Grav: Straighten up.
[ 04:41:53 ] - [FlyStark] Zero Grav: I said straigen up!
[ 04:41:56 ] - [FlyStark] Zero Grav: Nooo
[ 04:41:57 ] - [FlyStark] Zero Grav: ffs
[ 04:42:04 ] - [PDF Airman] xKamz: Straight!
[ 04:42:08 ] - [FlyStark] Zero Grav: When I say straiten up you straighten up.
[ 04:42:11 ] - [FlyStark] Zero Grav: You kept turning.
[ 04:42:21 ] - [PDF Airman] xKamz: Alright.
[ 04:42:23 ] - [PDF Airman] xKamz: Test #3
[ 04:42:46 ] - [FlyStark] Zero Grav: Straighten up.
[ 04:42:54 ] - [FlyStark] Zero Grav: Turn left
[ 04:43:03 ] - [FlyStark] Zero Grav: Keep turning
[ 04:43:05 ] - [FlyStark] Zero Grav: Uhhh
[ 04:43:08 ] - [FlyStark] Zero Grav: Turned too slow
[ 04:43:09 ] - [FlyStark] Zero Grav: Slow down
[ 04:43:12 ] - [FlyStark] Zero Grav: Lower
[ 04:43:13 ] - [FlyStark] Zero Grav: Too high
[ 04:43:15 ] - [FlyStark] Zero Grav: Left
[ 04:43:17 ] - [FlyStark] Zero Grav: Left
[ 04:43:18 ] - [FlyStark] Zero Grav: Left
[ 04:43:19 ] - [FlyStark] Zero Grav: LEft
[ 04:43:23 ] - [FlyStark] Zero Grav: Right
[ 04:43:33 ] - [FlyStark] Zero Grav: Too low!
[ 04:43:38 ] - [PDF Airman] xKamz: Alright.
[ 04:43:46 ] - [FlyStark] Zero Grav: And you said you could land.
[ 04:43:46 ] - [PDF Airman] xKamz: I was trying to type and just let it land itself.
[ 04:43:50 ] - [FlyStark] Zero Grav: You even transitioned.
[ 04:43:59 ] - [PDF Airman] xKamz: I didn't transition on purpsoe xD
[ 04:44:00 ] - [FlyStark] Zero Grav: I'm impressed.
[ 04:44:04 ] - [FlyStark] Zero Grav: What?
[ 04:44:07 ] - [PDF Airman] xKamz: I was typing and held S before hitting T.
[ 04:44:12 ] - [FlyStark] Zero Grav: Well now you see how you are susposed to do it.
[ 04:44:17 ] - [PDF Airman] xKamz: Yeah.
[ 04:44:21 ] - [FlyStark] Zero Grav: Ok
[ 04:44:21 ] - [PDF Airman] xKamz: I can't line up for shit.
[ 04:44:38 ] - [PDF Airman] xKamz: Oops
[ 04:44:55 ] - [FlyStark] Zero Grav: Okay.
[ 04:44:58 ] - [FlyStark] Zero Grav: Full trottle.
[ 04:45:04 ] - [FlyStark] Zero Grav: Let the plane lift off by itself.
[ 04:45:14 ] - [PDF Airman] xKamz: I held S...
[ 04:45:16 ] - [FlyStark] Zero Grav: Climb above 10deg noise high
[ 04:45:27 ] - [PDF Airman] xKamz: I went  around 12.
[ 04:45:48 ] - [FlyStark] Zero Grav: And onnce you have leveld off let go of shit.
[ 04:45:59 ] - [FlyStark] Zero Grav: And it would maintain a stable speed.
[ 04:46:01 ] - [FlyStark] Zero Grav: Don't force it.
[ 04:46:12 ] - [PDF Airman] xKamz: Ahhh.
[ 04:46:33 ] - [FlyStark] Zero Grav: And letting go of shift now.
[ 04:46:48 ] - [PDF Airman] xKamz: Let go of shit or shift?
[ 04:46:55 ] - [FlyStark] Zero Grav: shift.
[ 04:46:58 ] - [PDF Airman] xKamz: Ahhh.
[ 04:47:07 ] - [PDF Airman] xKamz: I released shift after takeoff xD.
[ 04:47:19 ] - [FlyStark] Zero Grav: Now turn slowely
[ 04:47:26 ] - [FlyStark] Zero Grav: Don't let you loose altitude on turns
[ 04:47:31 ] - [FlyStark] Zero Grav: Like how I'm doing
[ 04:47:37 ] - [PDF Airman] xKamz: I try not to
[ 04:47:40 ] - [PDF Airman] xKamz: But I'm bad.
[ 04:47:53 ] - [FlyStark] Zero Grav: Remember minor adjustments too the pitch
[ 04:48:00 ] - [FlyStark] Zero Grav: Don't hold S or W or A or D
[ 04:48:01 ] - [FlyStark] Zero Grav: Minor
[ 04:48:02 ] - [FlyStark] Zero Grav: Tap it
[ 04:48:51 ] - [FlyStark] Zero Grav: Once I reach that building I'd turn.
[ 04:49:16 ] - [FlyStark] Zero Grav: Once I'm over that island under us, I'd turn.
[ 04:49:19 ] - [PDF Airman] xKamz: You line up so much easier :/
[ 04:49:24 ] - [FlyStark] Zero Grav: Start slowing down.
[ 04:49:39 ] - [FlyStark] Zero Grav: Not lined up, I was typing.
[ 04:49:42 ] - [PDF Airman] xKamz: xD
[ 04:49:42 ] - [FlyStark] Zero Grav: Going around.
[ 04:49:48 ] - [PDF Airman] xKamz: I did the exact same thing.
[ 04:51:02 ] - [FlyStark] Zero Grav: Slowing down.
[ 04:51:07 ] - [FlyStark] Zero Grav: Full holding Ctrl
[ 04:51:15 ] - [FlyStark] Zero Grav: And turning.
[ 04:51:26 ] - [PDF Airman] xKamz: I was wayyy too high.
[ 04:51:28 ] - [FlyStark] Zero Grav: Noise above 10deg
[ 04:51:38 ] - [FlyStark] Zero Grav: 5*
[ 04:51:59 ] - [PDF Airman] xKamz: Transition.
[ 04:52:07 ] - [PDF Airman] xKamz: You make it look sooo easy :/
[ 04:52:08 ] - [FlyStark] Zero Grav: It was a bit smaller then normal
[ 04:52:26 ] - [FlyStark] Zero Grav: Remember don't force the plane.
[ 04:52:41 ] - [FlyStark] Zero Grav: On landing. Power for altitude and pitch for speed.
[ 04:52:59 ] - [PDF Airman] xKamz: I didn't know that xD.
[ 04:53:00 ] - [FlyStark] Zero Grav: Speed for altitude and pitch for speed.
[ 04:53:33 ] - [FlyStark] Zero Grav: Do you ever feel the ground is sneaking up on you?
[ 04:53:33 ] - [PDF Airman] xKamz: 500 meters high?
[ 04:53:38 ] - [PDF Airman] xKamz: No, not really.
[ 04:53:46 ] - [FlyStark] Zero Grav: Okay.
[ 04:53:47 ] - [FlyStark] Zero Grav: Good.
[ 04:54:03 ] - [PDF Airman] xKamz: Wait, what is that suppose to mean?
[ 04:54:06 ] - [FlyStark] Zero Grav: I try at 500 on my aproachs.
[ 04:54:08 ] - [FlyStark] Zero Grav: aproachs
[ 04:54:10 ] - [FlyStark] Zero Grav: aproaches
[ 04:54:12 ] - [FlyStark] Zero Grav: Wait.
[ 04:54:18 ] - [FlyStark] Zero Grav: I'd explain it more once we land.
[ 04:54:23 ] - [PDF Airman] xKamz: Okay
[ 04:54:32 ] - [FlyStark] Zero Grav: Now I'm slowely descending
[ 04:54:35 ] - [FlyStark] Zero Grav: Not forcing it.
[ 04:55:12 ] - [PDF Airman] xKamz: You swung out more that time.
[ 04:55:14 ] - [FlyStark] Zero Grav: Above 10deg
[ 04:55:17 ] - [PDF Airman] xKamz: Didn't go over the island xD
[ 04:55:22 ] - [FlyStark] Zero Grav: IK
[ 04:55:24 ] - [FlyStark] Zero Grav: ik
[ 04:55:59 ] - [FlyStark] Zero Grav: One more time.
[ 04:56:00 ] - [PDF Airman] xKamz: Lap #3
[ 04:56:17 ] - [FlyStark] Zero Grav: See that little upside down arrow on the Jethud?
[ 04:56:38 ] - [PDF Airman] xKamz: Climb to 500 > Turn left > Straight > turn left > Straight > Slowly descend > left > land?
[ 04:56:44 ] - [PDF Airman] xKamz: Yeah, why?
[ 04:56:56 ] - [FlyStark] Zero Grav: This will help you.
[ 04:57:01 ] - [FlyStark] Zero Grav: If you have a target like a runway.
[ 04:57:12 ] - [FlyStark] Zero Grav: Line the stick of the T with the center of the runway.
[ 04:57:30 ] - [FlyStark] Zero Grav: So you can know if you are coming in straight and if you are center.
[ 04:57:44 ] - [PDF Airman] xKamz: Oh, I never thought about that.
[ 04:57:57 ] - [FlyStark] Zero Grav: Just watch it careflly on this one.
[ 04:58:45 ] - [PDF Airman] xKamz: My laptop doesn't show the runway until I get really close.
[ 04:59:10 ] - [PDF Airman] xKamz: Woah
[ 04:59:21 ] - [FlyStark] Zero Grav: Right on the center line :P
[ 04:59:21 ] - [PDF Airman] xKamz: I always come in sideways xD
[ 04:59:26 ] - [FlyStark] Zero Grav: Yeah.
[ 04:59:30 ] - [FlyStark] Zero Grav: Don't worry.
[ 04:59:33 ] - [FlyStark] Zero Grav: Even in real life.
[ 04:59:39 ] - [FlyStark] Zero Grav: It's not the easiest thing to do.
[ 04:59:46 ] - [PDF Airman] xKamz: Landing irl sounds hard.
[ 04:59:59 ] - [PDF Airman] xKamz: I'm a ghost.
[ 05:00:01 ] - [FlyStark] Zero Grav:  You try now.
[ 05:00:03 ] - [FlyStark] Zero Grav: Hahahah'
[ 05:00:08 ] - [FlyStark] Zero Grav: Me too
[ 05:00:10 ] - [PDF Airman] xKamz: xD
[ 05:00:11 ] - [PDF Airman] xKamz: I love this
[ 05:00:21 ] - [FlyStark] Zero Grav: Use my plane.
[ 05:00:27 ] - [PDF Airman] xKamz: Why? xD
[ 05:00:27 ] - [FlyStark] Zero Grav: It's the training plane.
[ 05:00:41 ] - [PDF Airman] xKamz: But... it's damaged...
[ 05:00:48 ] - [PDF Airman] xKamz: Where'd it go?
[ 05:00:53 ] - [PDF Airman] xKamz: Oh
[ 05:01:21 ] - [FlyStark] Zero Grav: I see you use fparms
[ 05:01:42 ] - [PDF Airman] xKamz: I don't.
[ 05:01:46 ] - [PDF Airman] xKamz: Distracitons.
[ 05:01:51 ] - [PDF Airman] xKamz: Can't see shit.
[ 05:01:53 ] - [PDF Airman] xKamz: Clouds...
[ 05:02:20 ] - [FlyStark] Zero Grav: Don't type to me, just focus on the circut.
[ 05:02:30 ] - [FlyStark] Zero Grav: You are a bit high.
[ 05:02:31 ] - [PDF Airman] xKamz: I'm off course.
[ 05:03:01 ] - [PDF Airman] xKamz: I'm too off.
[ 05:03:11 ] - [FlyStark] Zero Grav: You came in too close to the runway.
[ 05:03:14 ] - [PDF Airman] xKamz: I know.
[ 05:03:16 ] - [FlyStark] Zero Grav: That is okay
[ 05:03:18 ] - [PDF Airman] xKamz: I couldn't see xD
[ 05:03:19 ] - [FlyStark] Zero Grav: Follow the highway
[ 05:03:21 ] - [FlyStark] Zero Grav: See the bridge
[ 05:03:26 ] - [FlyStark] Zero Grav: Follow the highway
[ 05:03:29 ] - [FlyStark] Zero Grav: Too high
[ 05:03:31 ] - [FlyStark] Zero Grav: Too fast
[ 05:03:33 ] - [FlyStark] Zero Grav: Go around
[ 05:03:34 ] - [PDF Airman] xKamz: Too off.
[ 05:03:37 ] - [FlyStark] Zero Grav: Don't try land
[ 05:03:39 ] - [FlyStark] Zero Grav: DOn't type.
[ 05:03:40 ] - [PDF Airman] xKamz: I'm not.
[ 05:03:43 ] - [PDF Airman] xKamz: But
[ 05:03:53 ] - [PDF Airman] xKamz: Then I can't comminucate.
[ 05:04:03 ] - [FlyStark] Zero Grav: If you have too then.
[ 05:04:37 ] - [PDF Airman] xKamz:  I can't see
[ 05:04:56 ] - [FlyStark] Zero Grav: Just keep it a bit higher
[ 05:05:02 ] - [FlyStark] Zero Grav: Look at your instruments
[ 05:05:10 ] - [FlyStark] Zero Grav: Hight, pitch, speed, etc.
[ 05:05:32 ] - [PDF Airman] xKamz: Heigh enough?
[ 05:05:38 ] - [FlyStark] Zero Grav: Start loosing altitude and turning
[ 05:05:41 ] - [FlyStark] Zero Grav: Yes
[ 05:05:47 ] - [FlyStark] Zero Grav: Lower
[ 05:05:48 ] - [FlyStark] Zero Grav: Stop
[ 05:05:50 ] - [FlyStark] Zero Grav: Straight
[ 05:05:52 ] - [FlyStark] Zero Grav: Good
[ 05:05:54 ] - [PDF Airman] xKamz: I was xD
[ 05:06:02 ] - [PDF Airman] xKamz: Left after island?
[ 05:06:03 ] - [FlyStark] Zero Grav: Turn
[ 05:06:09 ] - [FlyStark] Zero Grav: More
[ 05:06:10 ] - [FlyStark] Zero Grav: More
[ 05:06:19 ] - [FlyStark] Zero Grav: What are you doing?
[ 05:06:23 ] - [PDF Airman] xKamz: Crying
[ 05:06:23 ] - [FlyStark] Zero Grav: Follow the highway in.
[ 05:06:33 ] - [FlyStark] Zero Grav: Try that again.
[ 05:06:36 ] - [PDF Airman] xKamz: Alright.
[ 05:07:09 ] - [PDF Airman] xKamz: This weather sucks.
[ 05:07:16 ] - [PDF Airman] xKamz: Hoyl shit!
[ 05:07:27 ] - [PDF Airman] xKamz: Did you see that_ xD
[ 05:09:34 ] - [PDF Airman] xKamz: Are you AFK?
[ 05:10:18 ] - [FlyStark] Zero Grav: What happened.
[ 05:10:27 ] - [FlyStark] Zero Grav: Went to have a talk with someone.
[ 05:10:28 ] - [PDF Airman] xKamz: 7dick7 nearly crashed into us.
[ 05:10:37 ] - [FlyStark] Zero Grav: :O
[ 05:10:56 ] - [PDF Airman] xKamz: Yep
[ 05:11:05 ] - [PDF Airman] xKamz: xD
[ 05:12:41 ] - [PDF Airman] xKamz: I know, I was too ff.
[ 05:12:42 ] - [PDF Airman] xKamz: Off*
[ 05:12:43 ] - [PDF Airman] xKamz: And too fast.
[ 05:12:52 ] - [PDF Airman] xKamz: Also too high.
[ 05:13:11 ] - [PDF Airman] xKamz: I forgot about that xD
[ 05:13:19 ] - [PDF Airman] xKamz: Again?
[ 05:13:22 ] - [PDF Airman] xKamz: The rain finally stopped.
[ 05:13:26 ] - [PDF Airman] xKamz: I can see!
[ 05:13:39 ] - [PDF Airman] xKamz: Lap #5
[ 05:14:35 ] - [PDF Airman] xKamz: xD
[ 05:14:50 ] - [PDF Airman] xKamz: Most "Pilots" don't know how to fly.
[ 05:14:53 ] - [PDF Airman] xKamz: xD
[ 05:14:58 ] - [PDF Airman] xKamz: 7dick7's terrify me.
[ 05:16:11 ] - [PDF Airman] xKamz: Hard
[ 05:16:19 ] - [PDF Airman] xKamz: Everyone wants jobs.
[ 05:16:30 ] - [PDF Airman] xKamz: Like, Archkey is becoming a transpoter soon.
[ 05:16:33 ] - [PDF Airman] xKamz: Yeah.
[ 05:16:44 ] - [PDF Airman] xKamz: I should've gone lower before transitioing.
[ 05:16:51 ] - [PDF Airman] xKamz: Like he flies people back and forth.
[ 05:17:03 ] - [PDF Airman] xKamz: Go again?
[ 05:17:13 ] - [PDF Airman] xKamz: Yeah, in a plane.
[ 05:17:19 ] - [PDF Airman] xKamz: Like transports people back and forth
[ 05:17:26 ] - [PDF Airman] xKamz: None I think.
[ 05:18:18 ] - [PDF Airman] xKamz: xD
[ 05:18:22 ] - [PDF Airman] xKamz: He's gonna get busted.
[ 05:19:07 ] - [PDF Airman] xKamz: Yeah.
[ 05:19:10 ] - [PDF Airman] xKamz: 12 year olds.
[ 05:19:58 ] - [PDF Airman] xKamz: Not lined up.
[ 05:20:02 ] - [PDF Airman] xKamz: 6 year old orgy or nothing!
[ 05:20:13 ] - [PDF Airman] xKamz: Meh, I'll work on lining up later.
[ 05:20:16 ] - [PDF Airman] xKamz: Atleast I landed xD
[ 05:20:46 ] - [PDF Airman] xKamz: Most 12 year olds just jump in a Cassius then land one and they're like "Well, time to start my own Airline and charge people hundreds just
[ 05:20:49 ] - [PDF Airman] xKamz: for a crash land"
[ 05:20:50 ] - [PDF Airman] xKamz: sure
[ 05:21:10 ] - [PDF Airman] xKamz: Oops
[ 05:21:25 ] - [PDF Airman] xKamz: I'll practice doing that routine late.
[ 05:21:27 ] - [PDF Airman] xKamz: Later*
[ 05:21:45 ] - [PDF Airman] xKamz: Stalls?
[ 05:21:49 ] - [PDF Airman] xKamz: Why would you want to stall? xD
[ 05:22:11 ] - [PDF Airman] xKamz: I'm thinking of something else.
[ 05:22:13 ] - [PDF Airman] xKamz: Carry on.
[ 05:22:30 ] - [PDF Airman] xKamz: Archkey flys so much better then I do :/
[ 05:36:12 ] - [PDF Airman] xKamz: It'd be awesome if everyone that joined this server had to go through a instructor before being able to fly /
[ 05:39:57 ] - [PDF Airman] xKamz: You can spawn / despawn it anywhere.
[ 05:40:28 ] - [PDF Airman] xKamz: And real land that you can buy :/
[ 05:43:18 ] - [FlyStark] Zero Grav: You are really doing great.
[ 05:43:23 ] - [FlyStark] Zero Grav: I'm impressed so far.
[ 05:43:27 ] - [PDF Airman] xKamz: Me?
[ 05:43:34 ] - [FlyStark] Zero Grav: Yes.
[ 05:43:38 ] - [PDF Airman] xKamz: I'm horrible.
[ 05:43:43 ] - [FlyStark] Zero Grav: Naw.
[ 05:44:06 ] - [PDF Airman] xKamz: When could we practice emergency lands?
[ 05:44:11 ] - [FlyStark] Zero Grav: You think you have improed?
[ 05:44:16 ] - [FlyStark] Zero Grav: improved.
[ 05:44:29 ] - [PDF Airman] xKamz: Sort of. I understand a lot more about the Jethud now.
[ 05:44:40 ] - [PDF Airman] xKamz: And what levels to fly at.
[ 05:44:45 ] - [PDF Airman] xKamz: Also how to land.
[ 05:44:47 ] - [FlyStark] Zero Grav: And a lot more
[ 05:44:51 ] - [FlyStark] Zero Grav: Speeds etc.
[ 05:44:54 ] - [PDF Airman] xKamz: Yeah
[ 05:44:55 ] - [FlyStark] Zero Grav: You learnt a lo9t.
[ 05:44:57 ] - [FlyStark] Zero Grav: Stalls.
[ 05:45:00 ] - [PDF Airman] xKamz: Learnt a lot from just 1 lesson xD.
[ 05:45:00 ] - [FlyStark] Zero Grav: All that stuff.
[ 05:45:10 ] - [FlyStark] Zero Grav: It was 2 lessons.
[ 05:45:14 ] - [PDF Airman] xKamz: Shhh.
[ 05:45:20 ] - [FlyStark] Zero Grav: Hehe
[ 05:45:32 ] - [FlyStark] Zero Grav: And maybe get rid of the grapple hook :P
[ 05:45:42 ] - [FlyStark] Zero Grav: Idk
[ 05:45:45 ] - [PDF Airman] xKamz: Yeah.
[ 05:45:49 ] - [PDF Airman] xKamz: Grapple hook shouldn't be in this.
[ 05:45:59 ] - [PDF Airman] xKamz: Something that'd be nice is removing rain.
[ 05:46:19 ] - [FlyStark] Zero Grav: Hahahahah
[ 05:46:27 ] - [PDF Airman] xKamz: I hate rain ;-;
[ 05:46:46 ] - [FlyStark] Zero Grav: Do your homework, you oknow what we are doing in the next lesson.
[ 05:46:48 ] - [PDF Airman] xKamz: I finally found the tower I was looking for!
[ 05:47:12 ] - [FlyStark] Zero Grav: And you can only open your parachute one!
[ 05:47:15 ] - [FlyStark] Zero Grav: once*
[ 05:47:18 ] - [PDF Airman] xKamz: Yeah!!
[ 05:47:26 ] - [PDF Airman] xKamz: And, damage affects vehicles.
[ 05:47:32 ] - [FlyStark] Zero Grav: I want it too be super realistic.
[ 05:47:35 ] - [PDF Airman] xKamz: Like, your flaps get stuck.
[ 05:47:52 ] - [FlyStark] Zero Grav: But one problem.
[ 05:48:01 ] - [PDF Airman] xKamz: What if it had super realistic damage and to repair it, you'd have to take it to a repair hangar and pay.
[ 05:48:14 ] - [FlyStark] Zero Grav: He has too fix the glitch where planes blow up randomly.
[ 05:48:18 ] - [PDF Airman] xKamz: Omfg ikr.
[ 05:48:21 ] - [PDF Airman] xKamz: I hate that.
[ 05:48:38 ] - [FlyStark] Zero Grav: Because imagine he adds the money thing.
[ 05:48:49 ] - [PDF Airman] xKamz: Have you landed on the Three Kings strip yet?
[ 05:48:49 ] - [FlyStark] Zero Grav: Where you have to pay to get vehicles.
[ 05:48:57 ] - [PDF Airman] xKamz: Imagine trolls.
[ 05:49:02 ] - [FlyStark] Zero Grav: You get your brand new lovely Airhawk all custom colored
[ 05:49:12 ] - [FlyStark] Zero Grav: And it randomly explodes.
[ 05:49:17 ] - [PDF Airman] xKamz: I'd legit cry.
[ 05:49:34 ] - [PDF Airman] xKamz: Especially if it costed thousands.
[ 05:49:42 ] - [PDF Airman] xKamz: Realistic prices would be nice.
[ 05:50:06 ] - [FlyStark] Zero Grav: Realsitic prices would be anywhere frrom 30 thousand to 250 thousand
[ 05:50:21 ] - [PDF Airman] xKamz: Millions*
[ 05:50:25 ] - [FlyStark] Zero Grav: No
[ 05:50:29 ] - [PDF Airman] xKamz: 737...
[ 05:50:35 ] - [FlyStark] Zero Grav: Well for that
[ 05:50:37 ] - [PDF Airman] xKamz: xD
[ 05:50:41 ] - [PDF Airman] xKamz: Cassius is a million.. right?
[ 05:50:43 ] - [FlyStark] Zero Grav: But for a Airhawk.
[ 05:50:51 ] - [PDF Airman] xKamz: Airhawk would be rather cheap.
[ 05:50:59 ] - [PDF Airman] xKamz: But they're the best plane.
[ 05:51:04 ] - [FlyStark] Zero Grav: Cassius maybe a few hundred thousand or 2 million..
[ 05:51:14 ] - [PDF Airman] xKamz: I'd say a 1-3 million.
[ 05:51:20 ] - [FlyStark] Zero Grav: Airhawks around 30 to 100 thousand.
[ 05:51:30 ] - [PDF Airman] xKamz: What if they sold used ones!
[ 05:51:43 ] - [FlyStark] Zero Grav: Then more down in the 30 thousand mark
[ 05:52:10 ] - [PDF Airman] xKamz: Yah.
[ 05:52:28 ] - [PDF Airman] xKamz: Like, used ones could be near-new, near-broke, or any condition.
[ 05:52:35 ] - [FlyStark] Zero Grav: You wanna do the next lesson soon?
[ 05:52:37 ] - [PDF Airman] xKamz: Sure
[ 05:52:52 ] - [FlyStark] Zero Grav: And he has too add "back" the turbulence script.
[ 05:52:59 ] - [PDF Airman] xKamz: Turbulence script?
[ 05:53:09 ] - [FlyStark] Zero Grav: There was one on the server.
[ 05:53:13 ] - [FlyStark] Zero Grav: But people hated it.
[ 05:53:17 ] - [FlyStark] Zero Grav: So he removed it.
[ 05:53:20 ] - [PDF Airman] xKamz: It needs added back then.
[ 05:53:23 ] - [FlyStark] Zero Grav: I found it amazing.
[ 05:53:29 ] - [FlyStark] Zero Grav: It actually brang a challenging to flying.
[ 05:53:32 ] - [PDF Airman] xKamz: I just realised... I went through an entire lesson without crashing / blowing up.
[ 05:53:37 ] - [PDF Airman] xKamz: Flying is too easy.
[ 05:53:40 ] - [PDF Airman] xKamz: It needs more features.
[ 05:53:45 ] - [PDF Airman] xKamz: Landing needs more to it also.
[ 05:54:06 ] - [FlyStark] Zero Grav: And then once you land in stormy condition with turbulence and wind at a dangerous airfield you really feel good.
[ 05:54:08 ] - [PDF Airman] xKamz: Does different types of surface change traction?
[ 05:54:09 ] - [FlyStark] Zero Grav: And it's so tense
[ 05:54:15 ] - [FlyStark] Zero Grav: And your heart starts beating.
[ 05:54:20 ] - [PDF Airman] xKamz: xD adrenaline rush?
[ 05:54:26 ] - [FlyStark] Zero Grav: Hahah
[ 05:54:31 ] - [FlyStark] Zero Grav: It was just awesome.
[ 05:54:40 ] - [FlyStark] Zero Grav: I never felt any better about landing a plane.
[ 05:54:43 ] - [PDF Airman] xKamz: Landing on the north mountains airstrip would be so cool.
[ 05:54:53 ] - [FlyStark] Zero Grav: Yeah
[ 05:55:02 ] - [FlyStark] Zero Grav: Also add mist!
[ 05:55:05 ] - [PDF Airman] xKamz: The one burried in the forest.
[ 05:55:08 ] - [FlyStark] Zero Grav: And fog
[ 05:55:10 ] - [PDF Airman] xKamz: Fog!!!
[ 05:55:12 ] - [PDF Airman] xKamz: Omg yes.
[ 05:55:24 ] - [PDF Airman] xKamz: I want snow to change your traction.
[ 05:55:27 ] - [FlyStark] Zero Grav:  Make for some IFR flying conditions.
[ 05:55:34 ] - [PDF Airman] xKamz: Ifr?
[ 05:55:46 ] - [FlyStark] Zero Grav: There is VFR and IFR
[ 05:56:02 ] - [FlyStark] Zero Grav: We were flying vfr
[ 05:56:09 ] - [PDF Airman] xKamz: What do they stand for?
[ 05:56:20 ] - [FlyStark] Zero Grav: Visual flight rules
[ 05:56:30 ] - [PDF Airman] xKamz: Ahh.
[ 05:57:01 ] - [FlyStark] Zero Grav: Like in IFR there is a air traffic controller telling you where to go, if to turn left heading 330 or climb to an alititude of 3,000...
[ 05:57:02 ] - [FlyStark] Zero Grav: etc.
[ 05:57:33 ] - [PDF Airman] xKamz: That'd be awesome.
[ 05:57:43 ] - [FlyStark] Zero Grav: I wonder if he could make night times darker sometimes.
[ 05:57:53 ] - [PDF Airman] xKamz: That'd be coolish.
[ 05:58:00 ] - [PDF Airman] xKamz: Bit hard to see when you don't wanna fly.
[ 05:58:07 ] - [PDF Airman] xKamz: Increase headlights maybe.
[ 05:58:10 ] - [PDF Airman] xKamz: On cars &
[ 05:58:13 ] - [FlyStark] Zero Grav: Yeah.
[ 05:58:18 ] - -_.Скилл228._-: русские есть
[ 05:58:42 ] - [FlyStark] Zero Grav: Once this weather dies down we'd fly.
[ 05:58:48 ] - [PDF Airman] xKamz: Orrr, the feature to disable and eanble weather.
[ 05:58:55 ] - [FlyStark] Zero Grav: Also very harsh turbulence in weather like this.
[ 05:59:09 ] - [PDF Airman] xKamz: I want turbulence ;-;
[ 05:59:29 ] - [PDF Airman] xKamz: Imagine getting hit by lightning during a storm while in a plane.
[ 05:59:47 ] - [FlyStark] Zero Grav: The main problem about it was when you pressed T to type you are no longer controling the aircraft so the wind would push the plane into a d
[ 05:59:49 ] - [FlyStark] Zero Grav: dive.
[ 06:00:16 ] - [FlyStark] Zero Grav: Because you have to be always counter acting the wind.
[ 06:00:23 ] - [PDF Airman] xKamz: In the script?
[ 06:00:27 ] - [FlyStark] Zero Grav: Yeah.
[ 06:00:31 ] - [PDF Airman] xKamz: That'd be so much fun.
[ 06:00:41 ] - [FlyStark] Zero Grav: But then again typing.
[ 06:00:43 ] - [FlyStark] Zero Grav: A big problem.
[ 06:00:54 ] - [FlyStark] Zero Grav: Maybe when you type it disables turbulence.
[ 06:00:57 ] - [PDF Airman] xKamz: Could you send texts while flying a plane during a storm?
[ 06:01:07 ] - [FlyStark] Zero Grav: Nope, lol.
[ 06:01:08 ] - [PDF Airman] xKamz: Think about it.
[ 06:01:10 ] - [PDF Airman] xKamz: Realism.
[ 06:01:33 ] - [PDF Airman] xKamz: A disabling feature would be nice though.
[ 06:01:39 ] - Zacharia94: entering airport 3
[ 06:01:40 ] - [FlyStark] Zero Grav: Lembah Traffic. Airhawk Wisky Tango Foxtrot is taxing onto runway 04L. 
[ 06:02:21 ] - [FlyStark] Zero Grav: Lembah Traffic. Airhawk Wisky Tango Foxtrot is taking off runway O4L straight out VFR.
[ 06:02:46 ] - [PDF Airman] xKamz: What would be my name or whatever?
[ 06:02:55 ] - [FlyStark] Zero Grav: What?
[ 06:03:16 ] - [PDF Airman] xKamz: "Airhawk Wisky Tango Foxtrot"
[ 06:03:25 ] - [PDF Airman] xKamz: Wtf for short xD.
[ 06:03:29 ] - [FlyStark] Zero Grav: Well first is the type of aircraft you are in.
[ 06:03:39 ] - [FlyStark] Zero Grav: Every aircraft has a different call sign.
[ 06:04:07 ] - [PDF Airman] xKamz: So like Cassius (Name here)?
[ 06:04:13 ] - [FlyStark] Zero Grav: Yeah.
[ 06:04:16 ] - [PDF Airman] xKamz: Oh.
[ 06:04:16 ] - [FlyStark] Zero Grav: You can make up one.
[ 06:04:25 ] - [FlyStark] Zero Grav: Like for FlyStark the call signs are.
[ 06:05:40 ] - [PDF Airman] xKamz: Can't think of a callsign.
[ 06:06:01 ] - [FlyStark] Zero Grav: First Airhawk > ZK-WTF. Second Airhawk > 7159Q...And our Cassius is N97
[ 06:06:33 ] - [PDF Airman] xKamz: Wtf = Wednesday Thursday Friday.
[ 06:06:49 ] - [FlyStark] Zero Grav: Hahahah
[ 06:06:55 ] - [PDF Airman] xKamz: Ima go with 69-SMD
[ 06:07:29 ] - -_.Скилл228._-: русские сть 
[ 06:08:18 ] - [FlyStark] Zero Grav: Ugh
[ 06:08:30 ] - [PDF Airman] xKamz: Weathers clear.
[ 06:08:45 ] - [PDF Airman] xKamz: What is this airstrip called?
[ 06:08:52 ] - [FlyStark] Zero Grav: Lembah
[ 06:09:03 ] - [PDF Airman] xKamz: Not that one.
[ 06:09:04 ] - [PDF Airman] xKamz: f2
[ 06:09:23 ] - [FlyStark] Zero Grav: Ummmm.
[ 06:09:23 ] - [FlyStark] Zero Grav: I'd think bout it.
[ 06:09:27 ] - [PDF Airman] xKamz: Okay
[ 06:09:33 ] - -_.Скилл228._-: ты во внутерь сядь
[ 06:09:36 ] - [PDF Airman] xKamz: You should name all of your airstrips.
[ 06:09:42 ] - [FlyStark] Zero Grav: Oh god.
[ 06:09:44 ] - [PDF Airman] xKamz: Or atleast the best ones.
[ 06:09:56 ] - [PDF Airman] xKamz: Naming them all would take days xD.
[ 06:09:58 ] - алекс™: не могу
[ 06:10:15 ] - -_.Скилл228._-: возми такую же как у меня машину
[ 06:11:37 ] - [FlyStark] Zero Grav: I'm ready for our training.
[ 06:12:06 ] - [PDF Airman] xKamz: I just found out why you don't purposely stall under 1000m...
[ 06:12:16 ] - [FlyStark] Zero Grav: What happened?
[ 06:12:24 ] - [PDF Airman] xKamz: Trees....
[ 06:12:27 ] - [PDF Airman] xKamz: Plane...
[ 06:12:28 ] - [PDF Airman] xKamz: Boom.
[ 06:12:29 ] - [FlyStark] Zero Grav: :D
[ 06:12:35 ] - [FlyStark] Zero Grav: :o
[ 06:12:46 ] - [PDF Airman] xKamz: I'm trying to find an airstrip of yours.
[ 06:12:55 ] - [PDF Airman] xKamz: After I find it I'll be ready.
[ 06:13:06 ] - [FlyStark] Zero Grav: Oh, everyone was complaining about how the planes in JC2 couldn't reverse.....
[ 06:13:13 ] - [FlyStark] Zero Grav: They don't even reverse in real life.
[ 06:13:18 ] - [PDF Airman] xKamz: Wth would they reverse? xD
[ 06:13:26 ] - [FlyStark] Zero Grav: What?
[ 06:13:32 ] - [PDF Airman] xKamz: Wth = Why the hell.
[ 06:13:47 ] - [FlyStark] Zero Grav: Idkk
[ 06:13:57 ] - [PDF Airman] xKamz: Where's that little island airsrip?
[ 06:14:00 ] - [PDF Airman] xKamz: Airstrip*
[ 06:14:16 ] - [FlyStark] Zero Grav: The only plane that can actually reverse in real life on here in the 737, it has reverse thrust.
[ 06:14:47 ] - [PDF Airman] xKamz: Too bad the 737 sucks.
[ 06:15:23 ] - [PDF Airman] xKamz: Do you know where it is?

[ 20:54:05 ] - [PDF Cpl] BaxTabber: Not to be rude, and i'm not bashing the server. but uhh, a lot of arguments happen on this server
[ 20:54:08 ] - Wham!: You can't turn the Speed Hold on by turning on Auto Throttle then adjusting the knob and pushing it
[ 20:54:11 ] - Wham!: Or pulling it
[ 20:54:14 ] - Wham!: In Airbusses
[ 20:54:17 ] - [PDF Leader] salar29: And finally, the newest planes designed to face each other... A350 XWB or B787 Dreamliner?
[ 20:54:19 ] - [PDF Sldr] Chips: ajust ur knob
[ 20:54:45 ] - DaBeezKneez: in airbusses, you set the throttle to cruise setting and press A/T
[ 20:54:56 ] - Flubbl3: Ok, Its My Time To Start The Event, The Skydive XTreme!
[ 20:54:57 ] - DaBeezKneez: and then adjust it with a knob
[ 20:55:29 ] - juggerBro: wham wot r u doing :D

[ 20:55:33 ] - [PDF Cpl] BaxTabber: can i join
[ 20:55:38 ] - DaBeezKneez: its really not that different, the only thing is that the trottle has to be in a certian position
[ 20:55:43 ] - GoldSLorD | AWP KING: ,
[ 20:55:44 ] - [PDF Leader] salar29: Guys, 350 or 787??
[ 20:55:48 ] - Flubbl3: Join In DemonCore!
[ 20:55:48 ] - Wham!: In Boeing: Step 1 Turn On Autothrottle And Adjust Speed Knob To The Desired Speed Then Push The "SPEED" Button
[ 20:56:11 ] - Wham!: Flight Director does not need to be on for this
[ 20:56:12 ] - Flubbl3: Its The Skydive XTreme!
[ 20:56:30 ] - DaBeezKneez: are we talking about simplicity to use or how it actually works
[ 20:56:33 ] - Wham!: The Boeing 737 NG uses GE-56-6 Engines
[ 20:56:37 ] - Wham!: Both
[ 20:56:40 ] - Wham!: Both DaBeezKneez 
[ 20:56:44 ] - DaBeezKneez: because boeing allways wins in simplicity
[ 20:56:46 ] - Wham!: Debate Boeing VS Airbus
[ 20:56:57 ] - DemonCore: Wham! do you like the Boeing 777
[ 20:56:57 ] - [PDF Leader] salar29: Ok then, 787 vs 350?
[ 20:57:01 ] - DaBeezKneez: but airbus wins in every other category
[ 20:57:06 ] - [PDF Leader] salar29: 777 is my fav Boeing
[ 20:57:13 ] - DemonCore: its long AF lol
[ 20:57:16 ] - [PDF Leader] salar29: Ikr
[ 20:57:16 ] - DaBeezKneez: the airbus is designed for the pilot to do nothing
[ 20:57:18 ] - Wham!: Airbus: You aren't able to emergency descent with -3000 FPM without speedbrakes it will just pitch up
[ 20:57:34 ] - [PDF Leader] salar29: Wham! where is all that data from?
[ 20:57:37 ] - Wham!: If the airbus is designed for the pilot to do nothing then the pilot loses skills
[ 20:57:46 ] - Wham!: Salar I have knowledge
[ 20:57:49 ] - Flubbl3: First Dive, The Original Clasi
[ 20:57:50 ] - DaBeezKneez: i disagree
[ 20:57:57 ] - Wham!: Also pilot does alot of stuff in the Airbus same as the Boeing
[ 20:58:00 ] - [PDF Leader] salar29: If you're claiming Airbus is insecure, go check the crashes
[ 20:58:01 ] - Flubbl3: Classic.
[ 20:58:12 ] - [PDF Leader] salar29: Fewww
[ 20:58:13 ] - Wham!: Salar I have been in both Airbus and Boeing several times
[ 20:58:19 ] - Wham!: Including MD and Fokker
[ 20:58:30 ] - [PDF Leader] salar29: You are very biased towards Boeing though :(
[ 20:58:52 ] - juggerBro: where are u wanna go 
[ 20:58:58 ] - DaBeezKneez: i think boeing and airbus both have their stregnths and waeknesses as aircraft
[ 20:59:00 ] - Wham!: Airbus has a pretty steep take off rate at the start which causes it to lose a bit airspeed which can cause a stall if you are very unlucky
[ 20:59:09 ] - Wham!: Atleast Airbus A320
[ 20:59:09 ] - [PDF Leader] salar29: Wham! that isn't true
[ 20:59:17 ] - Wham!: Airbus A320 usually has a steep one
[ 20:59:20 ] - Wham!: Sometimes
[ 20:59:22 ] - Flubbl3: That Was Awesome!
[ 20:59:27 ] - Wham!: Yes some do not pitch up very much
[ 20:59:33 ] - [PDF Leader] salar29: Really depends on pilot experience
[ 20:59:35 ] - Wham!: Boeing trusts more on the pilot
[ 20:59:42 ] - Wham!: Airbus trust more the autopilot and fly by wire
[ 20:59:42 ] - Flubbl3: Next... 0 Fuel Diver!
[ 20:59:47 ] - [PDF Leader] salar29: That is true
[ 20:59:52 ] - DaBeezKneez: the airbus does have a very steep takeoff, but stalls are a problem with the compitence of the pilot
[ 21:00:03 ] - Wham!: Most crashes are done by pilot error
[ 21:00:14 ] - [PDF Leader] salar29: Gotta go guys bye
[ 21:00:18 ] - [PDF Sldr] Chips: cya
[ 21:00:21 ] - [Pilot] Bropiggypig: bai

[ 21:00:33 ] - Flubbl3: Afraid 0 People Are Joining In The Skydive XTreme.
[ 21:00:36 ] - Wham!: DaBeezKneez Let's debate more about Airbus And Boeing 
[ 21:00:37 ] - Wham!: It's kinda fun
[ 21:00:46 ] - Wham!: Actually
[ 21:00:54 ] - juggerBro: you havent kill me lol :D
[ 21:01:31 ] - [PDF Cpl] BaxTabber: flubb ill join
[ 21:01:37 ] - Wham!: Fly By Wire exists in Boeing 777 too but is not the same
[ 21:01:38 ] - Flubbl3: Ok,
[ 21:02:02 ] - DaBeezKneez: tbh, 777 is the best plane out there right now
[ 21:02:05 ] - Wham!: Airbus fly by wire is usually enabled at over 1000 feet after take off isn't that true
[ 21:02:09 ] - Flubbl3: Meet At R1 PIA.
[ 21:02:16 ] - Wham!: And Boeing 777 fly by wire is always on
[ 21:02:20 ] - Wham!: From start
[ 21:02:20 ] - Flubbl3: Meet At r1 Pia.
[ 21:02:42 ] - Wham!: To be honest I don't like future airplanes
[ 21:02:57 ] - Wham!: Cause they might have worse design that makes them look like spaceships
[ 21:02:59 ] - [PDF Cpl] BaxTabber: ill be back in 2mins flubb
[ 21:03:04 ] - Flubbl3: Ok,
[ 21:03:09 ] - Wham!: And worse cockpit full of screens
[ 21:03:17 ] - Wham!: Absolutely full of screens
[ 21:03:41 ] - DaBeezKneez: all they do is make your life simpler
[ 21:03:47 ] - Wham!: A340 is so long
[ 21:03:51 ] - Wham!: Of course it should be
[ 21:04:14 ] - DaBeezKneez: i fly the cessna 172 with the Garmin 1000, the cockpit is all screens, its great
[ 21:04:16 ] - Wham!: DaBeezKneez Warp
[ 21:04:29 ] - Wham!: Let's fly the HondaJet while talking
[ 21:04:35 ] - DaBeezKneez: and it makes it easier for the co-pilot so we can switch screens
[ 21:04:42 ] - Wham!: I fly the PMDG 737 NG and Airbus X A320
[ 21:05:19 ] - Flubbl3: Has Anyone Got Flight Radar?
[ 21:05:24 ] - Wham!: DaBeezKneez Can you tell me how it feels to control the Cessna 172 
[ 21:05:29 ] - DaBeezKneez: i just bought the pmdg 737 ngx, and i have the aerosoft airbusess a318, a 318, a320, and a321
[ 21:05:41 ] - DaBeezKneez: it feels great
[ 21:05:54 ] - Wham!: Today I did a flight EKCH - ESSA Cruise At FL200 Cruise Speed 330 - 300 
[ 21:06:04 ] - Wham!: Flight was about 82 minutes long
[ 21:06:09 ] - Wham!: I never speed up my flights
[ 21:06:26 ] - DaBeezKneez: i fly on VATSIM
[ 21:06:30 ] - Wham!: DaBeezKneez Warp
[ 21:06:46 ] - Wham!: GEt In
[ 21:06:46 ] - Wham!: ;D
[ 21:06:54 ] - Wham!: DaBeezKneez Can you tell me how it feels to control the Cessna 172 
[ 21:07:00 ] - Wham!: VR
[ 21:07:15 ] - Wham!: It is very smooth to control yes
[ 21:07:17 ] - DaBeezKneez: the 172 takes a little bit to get used to. but once you get it its pretty easy
[ 21:07:35 ] - Wham!: Isn't the controls in the C172 pretty sensitive
[ 21:07:38 ] - Wham!: Judging by videos
[ 21:07:40 ] - DaBeezKneez: the smoothness veries, it depends on maintinence and age of the aircraft
[ 21:07:54 ] - Flubbl3: Hello!
[ 21:08:08 ] - DaBeezKneez: well, the one thing you have to think of when flying a small aircaft is its all cables to the flight surfaces
[ 21:08:16 ] - DaBeezKneez: no hydraulics or anything
[ 21:08:21 ] - Wham!: Okay
[ 21:08:22 ] - Wham!: ;D
[ 21:08:30 ] - DaBeezKneez: so the farther you turn, the harder it is to turn the yoke
[ 21:08:38 ] - Wham!: Okay
[ 21:08:39 ] - Wham!: ;D
[ 21:08:41 ] - [PDF Airman] xKamz: Back
[ 21:08:58 ] - DaBeezKneez: its not as sensative as it looks
[ 21:09:02 ] - Wham!: Okay
[ 21:09:09 ] - Wham!: Winds can be a factor too
[ 21:09:56 ] - Wham!: DaBeezKneez How would you say a C172 engine is from the outside at idle power
[ 21:10:01 ] - DaBeezKneez: wind has a major factor, over the weekend, i landed right before a big storm and when i was parked sitting in the plane i felt it getting up
[ 21:10:06 ] - [PDF Cpl] BaxTabber: Back!
[ 21:10:10 ] - [PDF Airman] xKamz: Wb

[ 21:11:34 ] - DaBeezKneez: it all depends, my training aircraft had no sound proofing so, it was quite loud, the ones i rent now are pretty well sound proofed
[ 21:11:42 ] - DaBeezKneez: and it all depends on the headset too
