[ 13:42:52 ] - [PDF Leader] salar29: Me?
[ 13:42:55 ] - Obamallama: 25
[ 13:42:58 ] - [PDF Leader] salar29: oh you mean in general?
[ 13:43:04 ] - ToxicFibre: in genral
[ 13:43:31 ] - Obamallama: ikaas is joining
[ 13:43:31 ] - [PDF Leader] salar29: make it a 5% chance, that when you go over the CRUISE speed of a plane, you can have a fuel leak (zero fuel)
[ 13:43:38 ] - [PDF Leader] salar29: THAT would be WONDERful
[ 13:44:19 ] - Obamallama: I think there should be turbulance in storms
[ 13:44:26 ] - Wam: Hi
[ 13:44:31 ] - [PDF Soldier] AV8R: ikr
[ 13:44:35 ] - Obamallama: sup
[ 13:44:35 ] - [PDF Leader] salar29: And that if you take off with more than 75% of the cruise speed of a plane, the landing gear might not come down when landing
[ 13:44:52 ] - Obamallama: yeah
[ 13:44:53 ] - [PDF Soldier] AV8R: ooo
[ 13:45:29 ] - [Heisters.net] lkaas: Hi guys
[ 13:45:35 ] - Obamallama: hi ikaas
[ 13:45:36 ] - [PDF Leader] salar29: Turbulence in storms, could cause a loss of control in one of the systems, so like autopilot
[ 13:45:44 ] - Obamallama: yeah
[ 13:45:55 ] - [PDF Leader] salar29: i need to tell tally or dom some of these if only i could :c
[ 13:46:01 ] - Obamallama: we're discussing ideas for the server ikaas
[ 13:46:29 ] - Obamallama: toxic could tell them
[ 13:46:32 ] - ToxicFibre: i have
[ 13:46:42 ] - [PDF Leader] salar29: Whcih ones?

[ 13:46:49 ] - [Heisters.net] lkaas: I like the idea of tubulence
[ 13:46:58 ] - [PDF Leader] salar29: i like the no landing gear
[ 13:47:07 ] - [PDF Leader] salar29: trying to make a belly landing would be awesome
[ 13:47:15 ] - ToxicFibre: your going too far now
[ 13:47:15 ] - [PDF Leader] salar29: if only the physics in JC2 allowed it
[ 13:47:29 ] - [Heisters.net] lkaas: It could be implemented as varying input on the veritcal and roll
[ 13:47:36 ] - MatMix ツ: this plane dont sound healthy haha
[ 13:47:38 ] - [PDF Leader] salar29: sadly, JC2 physics would make the plane explode
[ 13:47:52 ] - Wam: Sorry
[ 13:47:53 ] - [PDF Leader] salar29: just by touching a wing slightly on the ground D:
[ 13:47:58 ] - [PDF Soldier] AV8R: I want a belly landing ! With sparks!
[ 13:47:58 ] - MatMix ツ: It's okay no worry xD
[ 13:48:05 ] - [PDF Leader] salar29: which one did you tell him ,toxic?
