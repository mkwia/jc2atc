[ 03:26:10 ] - [FlyStark] Neo: if PDF fell apart
[ 03:26:20 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: It was causing too much mayham because my co-leaders were shit.
[ 03:26:27 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: Hazzar wanted to own everything, and Thief wasn't comitted.
[ 03:26:30 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: None shared my ideals.
[ 03:26:41 ] - [PDF Airman] 4life: whos fault was it to promote them?
[ 03:26:41 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: But now, my co-leaders are fuckin kickass.

[ 03:26:51 ] - [FlyStark] Neo: Alright
[ 03:26:53 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: It wasn't a fault. Thief and I merged.
[ 03:27:01 ] - [FlyStark] Zero Grav: You can come too.
[ 03:27:21 ] - [FlyStark] Zero Grav: Someone left there cooker on :D
[ 03:27:28 ] - [FlyStark] Neo: I suppose it beats hanging out here
[ 03:27:30 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: So, yeah, I guess you can say it was my fault to merge with their organization, but I was under the false impression that their organization

[ 03:27:34 ] - [FlyStark] Zero Grav: Shame on them.
[ 03:27:47 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: shared my ideals for a defense group, but they were for tyranny and oppression.
[ 03:27:52 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: I mean, they fuckin owned AP3.

[ 03:29:32 ] - [PDF Airman] 4life: ME?
[ 03:29:38 ] - [PDF Airman] 4life: me?
[ 03:29:39 ] - [FlyStark] Neo: Cassius service is most expensive.
[ 03:29:46 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: You weren't making us stronger, you were making more enemies by engaging people simply for coming near AP3.
[ 03:29:54 ] - [FlyStark] Zero Grav: For you Kamz it would be $100
[ 03:29:59 ] - [PDF Cpl.] xKamz: You only opperate Cassius' during storms, right?
[ 03:30:00 ] - [FlyStark] Zero Grav: Since you are a close friend.
[ 03:30:03 ] - [PDF Airman] 4life: imatheif also did so

[ 03:30:08 ] - [PDF Airman] 4life: plus
[ 03:30:12 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: And I'll admit, I have some territories that are mostly off limits to known assholes, but not main airports like AP3.
[ 03:30:15 ] - [PDF Cpl.] xKamz: Ima wait until the storm is down.
[ 03:30:17 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: Yeah, Thief did it, and so did Titan.
[ 03:30:22 ] - [PDF Airman] 4life: dude
[ 03:30:26 ] - [PDF Airman] 4life: they attacked
[ 03:30:26 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: Titan was actually the downfall of the PDF, when he engaged Salar for no reason.
[ 03:30:27 ] - [FlyStark] Neo: All times but we don't have Airhawks during stroms
[ 03:30:27 ] - [FlyStark] Zero Grav: You want a pickup?

[ 06:29:05 ] - [PDF Soldier] xKamz: I'm pretty sure you'd be [PDF Soldier] Hcarde1 / [PDF Airman] Hcarde1.
[ 06:29:11 ] - [PDF Soldier] xKamz: The tags are sooo long.
[ 06:29:12 ] - [Fg] grobin: is there a way to despawn planes at an airport? 
[ 06:29:18 ] - Hcarde1: I know
[ 06:29:30 ] - Hcarde1: Not that I know of
[ 06:29:44 ] - [Fg] grobin: so if a plane is at a runway with 0 fuel = lost
[ 06:29:49 ] - [PDF Soldier] xKamz: I wish it was just stuff like [PDF S] <-- Soldier.
[ 06:30:02 ] - Hcarde1: Yeah
[ 06:31:57 ] - Hcarde1: Yes [Fg] grobin

[ 06:35:32 ] - Hcarde1: I don't think this counts as an airstrip
[ 06:35:35 ] - [PDF Soldier] xKamz: It is.
[ 06:35:51 ] - Hcarde1: Cool
[ 06:35:55 ] - [PDF Soldier] xKamz: It's not an Official Panau airstrip, but it's an emergency / secret strip.
[ 06:36:04 ] - Hcarde1: yeah
[ 06:36:08 ] - [PDF Soldier] xKamz: Try to land on it.
[ 06:36:10 ] - [Fg] grobin: ohh

[ 07:37:41 ] - [PDF Lieutenant] LAG: well...
[ 07:37:41 ] - [FlyStark] Zero Grav: then at the last second you add power to join over the ledges and land.

[ 16:44:15 ] - [PDF Soldier] Shotz: :D
[ 16:44:21 ] - [PDF Leader] salar29: Well, our main issue in my opinion was the lack of STICKING TOGETHER
[ 16:44:24 ] - [PDF Cpl] BaxTabber: I'm tired of this "stunt" "group flight" crap
[ 16:44:32 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: First and foremost, when someone's in a parachute and firing at you, no matter what they're using, you get in the air with them.
[ 16:44:39 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: It's nearly impossible to hit them with ground fire.
[ 16:44:44 ] - [PDF Soldier] Shotz: i did sir.
[ 16:44:53 ] - [PDF Leader] salar29: One was on Pled, one was on DESTROYED, one was on Crecka, WE HAVE TO GO TOGETHER
[ 16:44:59 ] - [PDF Airman]Jenkin: hes shooting me!
[ 16:44:59 ] - [PDF Leader] salar29: One by one
[ 16:45:01 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: I know you did, Shotz, but nobody else did when I told them to.
[ 16:45:03 ] - [PDF Airman]Jenkin: [jk]
[ 16:45:07 ] - [PDF Leader] salar29: Might be slower but much safer
[ 16:45:07 ] - [PDF Soldier] Shotz: Sir.
[ 16:45:20 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: Sticking together isn't an issue...
[ 16:45:23 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: Coming together is.
[ 16:45:26 ] - [PDF Soldier] Shotz: yep
[ 16:45:26 ] - [PDF Leader] salar29: It is though
[ 16:45:27 ] - [PDF Cpl] BaxTabber: I did not see your chat, sir. I apologize. Sawed-off was working good from the ground, though
[ 16:45:31 ] - [PDF Leader] salar29: We don't get together
[ 16:45:37 ] - [PDF Leader] salar29: If we stuck together in fights
[ 16:45:39 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: We need to be able to mobilize in a moment's notice.
[ 16:45:42 ] - [PDF Lieutenant] LAG: wars*
[ 16:45:51 ] - TFF JUD0: orlex inv me skorp
[ 16:45:52 ] - [PDF Leader] salar29: 1. We'd kill them much easier and 2. We'd die much less
[ 16:45:54 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: And Salar, F2 isn't evil. Sometimes warping is necessary.
[ 16:46:01 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: Ok, seriously, who the fuck is shooting?
[ 16:46:12 ] - [PDF Leader] salar29: We have KOS's but we focus on one mainly
