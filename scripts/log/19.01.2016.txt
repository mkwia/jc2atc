[ 20:50:38 ] - [PDF Lieutenant] LAG: just as many people support my nation as they do Kage's

[ 20:51:04 ] - Chairman Kage: he said Salar just told him
[ 20:51:05 ] - salar29: He just told me he never agreed and that you cannot own land in East Tanah Raya
[ 20:51:13 ] - Chairman Kage: Do you want a war, Lag?
[ 20:51:15 ] - salar29: Because it is PDF main territory
[ 20:51:23 ] - [PDF Lieutenant] LAG: what does he have with East Tanah Raya?
[ 20:51:27 ] - [PDF Lieutenant] LAG: hmm

[ 20:52:16 ] - Chairman Kage: lag is stepping on thin ice.
[ 20:52:18 ] - salar29: LAG, I'm pretty sure claiming a piece of land in a PDF-owned region is not following PDF rules...
[ 20:52:33 ] - salar29: Even less when it's our main region
[ 20:52:34 ] - [SERGEANT]SS4: hey kage i thought you liked peace and now you want a war with LAG??? not very peaceful
[ 20:52:35 ] - [PDF Lieutenant] LAG: It's about Kage acting like my grandad
[ 20:52:36 ] - salar29: And when it's LAND!
[ 20:52:42 ] - Chairman Kage: I am not at war with him.
[ 20:52:49 ] - Chairman Kage: SS4, we have not declared war.

[ 20:53:00 ] - [SERGEANT]SS4: you said "You want a war LAG?"
[ 20:53:04 ] - Chairman Kage: YES.
[ 20:53:09 ] - Chairman Kage: that was a simple question.
[ 20:53:13 ] - salar29: Because he would be against what everyone in PDF wanted
[ 20:53:15 ] - [PDF Lieutenant] LAG: salar i am not trying to start war over land...again
[ 20:53:24 ] - Chairman Kage: Did I say "do you want a war with me?"
[ 20:53:28 ] - [PDF Lieutenant] LAG: yes
[ 20:53:30 ] - [SERGEANT]SS4: but he just tryed to claim a region
