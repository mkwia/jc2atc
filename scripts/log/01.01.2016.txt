[ 10:39:57 ] - Dom2364: I can demonstrate

[ 10:40:39 ] - [PDF Leader] salar29: Why?
[ 10:40:50 ] - Dom2364: when it restarts it doesnt clear the last trail
[ 10:40:58 ] - [PDF Leader] salar29: Oh
[ 10:41:15 ] - [PDF Leader] salar29:  But not the whole trail stays, only some of it
[ 10:41:20 ] - Dom2364: and doing this enough will cause a crash
[ 10:41:25 ] - [PDF Leader] salar29: Oh
[ 10:41:31 ] - Dom2364: yeah it will only keep what was in the buffer
[ 10:41:46 ] - [PDF Leader] salar29: And do you know how it can be fixed?
[ 10:41:57 ] - Dom2364: should be pretty easy to fix
