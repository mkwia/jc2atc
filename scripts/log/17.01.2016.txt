[ 06:19:00 ] - [PDF General]Nody: no more abt religion, stop and play
[ 06:19:16 ] - [TD Leader] MatMix ツ: It appeared from invasion of Iraq but it's goal is to remove the empire regmines inside Saudi and Turkey

[ 06:20:56 ] - [PDF General]Nody: Okay Guys, Enjoy yourself
[ 06:20:56 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: That's the "IL" part.
[ 06:21:15 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: I would talk about "IS" but I'm now allowed to talk about Religion, which I'm fine with because it's a touchy subject.
[ 06:21:19 ] - [PDF General]Nody: contact me if you need , i am on steam 
[ 06:21:20 ] - [TD Leader] MatMix ツ: Yes but ISIL is not a real name.. the leader himself of this group has said. It was this but no longer about Iraq :)

[ 06:21:52 ] - [PDF Soldier] xKamz: Raining*
[ 06:21:57 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: Correct, but it's name isn't Daesh either.
[ 06:22:03 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: It's still officially ISIL.
[ 06:22:16 ] - [TD Leader] MatMix ツ: Well you give them the things they want.. notice. Call them Daesh 
[ 06:22:18 ] - [PDF Soldier] xKamz: MOTHERFUCKING

[ 06:22:42 ] - [TD Leader] MatMix ツ: They want you to think it's ISIL.. but you have to understand Daesh has a purpose to it.. just look it up :)
[ 06:22:49 ] - [TD Leader] MatMix ツ: you thank me later, cause it offends them xD
[ 06:22:54 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: I know this.
[ 06:23:05 ] - [FlyStark] Zero Grav: #PrayForIsrael
[ 06:23:14 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: But their official name is ISIL. I'm not saying I'm not calling them Daesh, but what you call them doesn't matter in this chat rn.
[ 06:23:21 ] - [TD Leader] MatMix ツ: I also think it's shameful that certain countries use "terrorism" to take our laws away.. while claiming 
[ 06:23:22 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: It matters when speeking to or about them.
[ 06:23:24 ] - [FlyStark] Zero Grav: Wait, what are we talking about here?
[ 06:23:25 ] - [TD Leader] MatMix ツ: terrorist will never win.
[ 06:23:26 ] - [FlyStark] Zero Grav: I'm confused..

[ 06:23:31 ] - [PDF Soldier] xKamz: I'm so lost.
[ 06:23:34 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: Mat, you're right on that subject.
[ 06:23:38 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: To a point.
[ 06:23:39 ] - [PDF Soldier] Slayer: this is a debate about terrorists
[ 06:23:58 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: In some situations, freedoms must be sacrificed for security.
[ 06:24:02 ] - [PDF Soldier] Slayer: come in
[ 06:24:05 ] - [PDF Soldier] Slayer: ill drive u
[ 06:24:21 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: Now, banning Muslims from the U.S isn't right, and is way too far.
[ 06:24:27 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: #FuckDonaldTrump
[ 06:24:28 ] - [TD Leader] MatMix ツ: Yes but to what point? These groups appear when it benifits our governments.. it's weird
[ 06:24:47 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: Mat, I'm not about to argue about conspiracy theories.
[ 06:24:50 ] - [TD Leader] MatMix ツ: The moment our governments needs our rights taken away, something pops up scaring us and they take them away lol
[ 06:25:01 ] - [TD Leader] MatMix ツ: Seems weird doesn't it?
[ 06:25:06 ] - [PDF Soldier] Slayer: Mat, these groups appear when there is something in their country that is wrong and they want it changed, not for good or worse. just change
[ 06:25:13 ] - [TD Leader] MatMix ツ: No.. lol
[ 06:25:21 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: lolno
[ 06:25:22 ] - [TD Leader] MatMix ツ: So the invasion of Iraq has nothing to do with it?
[ 06:25:25 ] - [PDF Soldier] Slayer: and example of this would be the tea party back in 1800s
[ 06:25:30 ] - [TD Leader] MatMix ツ: the wmd? where was them??
[ 06:25:33 ] - [PDF Soldier] Slayer: ofc it does
[ 06:25:34 ] - [TD Leader] MatMix ツ: tell me please someone.. where?
[ 06:25:43 ] - [TD Leader] MatMix ツ: We invaded Iraq illegally.. like Syria..
[ 06:25:46 ] - [TD Leader] MatMix ツ: you wonder why people want us dead.
[ 06:25:47 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: We're not talking about political parties, we're talking about extremist millitant organizations such as ISIL and Boko Horam.
[ 06:25:55 ] - [TD Leader] MatMix ツ: If we did this to them.. it would be all over the world outrage..
[ 06:26:01 ] - [TD Leader] MatMix ツ: we invade the middle-east.. ahh it's okay no worries.
[ 06:26:08 ] - [TD Leader] MatMix ツ: Just asian, muslim children, families being killed.
[ 06:26:11 ] - [TD Leader] MatMix ツ: Who cares.. lol
[ 06:26:12 ] - [PDF Soldier] Slayer: walker the tea party was an extremist group at one point in us history
[ 06:26:26 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: *Millitant*
[ 06:26:46 ] - [TD Leader] MatMix ツ: Weird how Obama is supporting Turkey, who is attacking the Kurds who is attacking the terrorist who want to kill us?
[ 06:26:50 ] - [TD Leader] MatMix ツ: Does this make sense? lol
[ 06:27:07 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: Obama supports Turkey because they're the only country in the region who is doing something.
[ 06:27:15 ] - [TD Leader] MatMix ツ: Why would the president of "world peace" support Saudi Arabia and Turkey, who openly buy oil from terrorists?
[ 06:27:20 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: Yes, they are attacking Kurdistan, however they're also attacking ISIS.
[ 06:27:21 ] - [TD Leader] MatMix ツ: Turkey?? Lol
[ 06:27:22 ] - [TD Leader] MatMix ツ: hahahah

[ 06:27:47 ] - [PDF Soldier] Slayer: kamz, its a debate about militant groups
[ 06:27:49 ] - [TD Leader] MatMix ツ: Yeah please..
[ 06:28:01 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: Same reason we're supporting Russia in ISIS, while ISIS bombs Syrian Rebels who we're supporting.
[ 06:28:07 ] - [TD Leader] MatMix ツ: Turkey is nothing but buying oil from them.. search it up and see the valid proof. America is only interested in money.
[ 06:28:17 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: The Middle East and the nations involved in it are all involved in a fuckfest, and nothing about it is simple!
[ 06:28:32 ] - [TD Leader] MatMix ツ: Yeah nothing is simple.. but if you look at history and see who invaded who.. then you might see who is to blame.
[ 06:28:39 ] - [PDF Soldier] Slayer: mat, the turkish oil supply in group is lower than the amount us has in reserve
[ 06:28:40 ] - [TD Leader] MatMix ツ: I did not see Iran invade America.. or Libya..
[ 06:28:43 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: America is interested in Money. Money is secured by stabilization.
[ 06:29:03 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: The U.S didn't invade Libya. We assisted the rebels in overthrowing Quadaffi.
[ 06:29:07 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: No clue how to spell his name BTW.
[ 06:29:17 ] - [TD Leader] MatMix ツ: I had a woman who is journalist she told me.. she went to Iraq.. interviewed loads of people.. said to them.. do you know

[ 06:29:37 ] - [TD Leader] MatMix ツ: We killed millions of them..
[ 06:29:47 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: I'm not saying the invasion of Iraq was right.
[ 06:29:49 ] - [TD Leader] MatMix ツ: For what? they knew nothing.. but we had the right to drop bombs on them sleeping? xD
[ 06:29:49 ] - [PDF Soldier] xKamz: "We" as in you live in America?
[ 06:29:55 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: It was, in fact, wrong.
[ 06:30:02 ] - [TD Leader] MatMix ツ: No I am from the UK.. both America and UK did this together..
[ 06:30:06 ] - [TD Leader] MatMix ツ: It's shameful
[ 06:30:15 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: Why does everyone in the UK type like shit?
[ 06:30:27 ] - [TD Leader] MatMix ツ: Cause we not like you Americans.. who think typing online makes you look cool.

[ 06:31:22 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: Yeah, I'm not proud of that.
[ 06:31:28 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: That's not the U.S. That's the U.S Media.
[ 06:31:34 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: And your media did the exact same thing.
[ 06:31:34 ] - [PDF Soldier] Slayer: uk stole my countries riches
[ 06:31:43 ] - [PDF Soldier] Slayer: no country is innocent
[ 06:31:43 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: It's not U.S Media, or U.K Media, it's western media.
[ 06:31:48 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: The *British Empire*
[ 06:31:54 ] - [TD Leader] MatMix ツ: Yeah the US media is bought out.. why the US is allowed to invade all the time. You know why I'm anti America..

[ 06:32:34 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: They've been doing it since the beginning of western civilization.
[ 06:32:35 ] - [TD Leader] MatMix ツ: because we invaded his country, following the USA.
[ 06:32:40 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: Hell, we're following you!

[ 06:33:01 ] - [TD Leader] MatMix ツ: Not a good role model when you invade loads.
[ 06:33:07 ] - [PDF Soldier] Slayer: usa became a wold super power since 1919, everyone followed its command because if they didn't they miss out of manmy trade opportunities
[ 06:33:09 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: Like the British Empire?

[ 06:37:54 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: Russia was the one who invaded.
[ 06:37:57 ] - [PDF Soldier] Slayer: The reason why SA is not blown off the map bis because USA set up a aproxy government
[ 06:37:58 ] - [TD Leader] MatMix ツ: Helped?

[ 06:38:23 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: Drugs?
[ 06:38:31 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: Drugs are used by the Talbian to fuel their troops.

[ 06:38:46 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: That's how they stand a chance against U.S troops.
[ 06:38:53 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: Those drugs turn them in to litteral supersoldiers.
[ 06:38:58 ] - [FlyStark] Neo: Doubt it Kamz.
[ 06:39:08 ] - [TD Leader] MatMix ツ: Well use have left afghan now and have a few troops left inside.. the taliban took back majority of the parts again
[ 06:39:08 ] - [PDF Soldier] Slayer: The reason why they produced cannibis is because drugs are a high profit industry
[ 06:39:13 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: We aren't against Afghanistan. We're assistang their military.
[ 06:39:19 ] - [PDF Soldier] Slayer: sorry opium

[ 06:40:09 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: You're right, mat.
[ 06:40:19 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: But you can't kill an Idea.
[ 06:40:36 ] - [TD Leader] MatMix ツ: No you cannot, but you are able to stop it from spreading. Something NATO has failed to do.

[ 06:41:00 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: We're about to.
[ 06:41:27 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: We can stop it from spreading, but at the same time, we can't.
[ 06:41:37 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: I mean, there will always be the threat of lone-wolf terrorists.
[ 06:41:53 ] - [TD Leader] MatMix ツ: Europe is on the brink of a war.. we are being flooded with refugees. America started bombing Syria.. result in refugees fleeing here.
[ 06:41:56 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: There will always be the thought of Islamic Extremism, just like that of Christian Extremism. Unfortunatly, we can't get in to this.
[ 06:41:59 ] - [PDF Soldier] Slayer: Mat, the mess in middle east was caused by the allies althe way back in ww1 in versailles. The allies needed to divide ME up between differe
[ 06:42:01 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: No religion and what not.
[ 06:42:02 ] - [TD Leader] MatMix ツ: You know how sad it is for them? most of them lost there families..
[ 06:42:06 ] - [FlyStark] Zero Grav: Can you guy's take this conversation to the PDF group chat? It's pretty distracting.

[ 06:43:12 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: The U.S hasn't done anything to help.
[ 06:43:19 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: Your country hasn't either.
[ 06:43:28 ] - [TD Leader] MatMix ツ: Sorry but, middle-east did not need no ones help. We have enemies all the time here.. we never see Iran asking to help us?
[ 06:43:29 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: We wouldn't be here arguing about it if it weren't for your country's massive imperialism.
[ 06:43:32 ] - [PDF Soldier] xKamz: Mat, please start using "You" instead of "Use"... it bothers me.
[ 06:43:34 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: But that shit happened.
[ 06:43:44 ] - [TD Leader] MatMix ツ: I do not care lol
[ 06:44:14 ] - [TD Leader] MatMix ツ: Simple fact is.. maybe if the US stopped poking around in the middle-east like it owns the place.. and focus on it's own people.
[ 06:44:19 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: Somehow, the British Empire's legacy hasn't haunted the U.K, but the United States' has.
[ 06:44:26 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: If we don't do something about ISIL now, it'll spread.
[ 06:44:28 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: It'll grow.
[ 06:44:33 ] - [TD Leader] MatMix ツ: you have veterans on the streets in your country.. but your government can put 500million on a group of 60 peoplee who all fled to isis?
[ 06:44:37 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: We need to kill it, and we need an invasion to do that.
[ 06:44:40 ] - [TD Leader] MatMix ツ: they care about americans dont they.
[ 06:44:58 ] - [TD Leader] MatMix ツ: No in vasions created this mess.
[ 06:45:03 ] - [TD Leader] MatMix ツ: That is simple to see.
[ 06:45:11 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: Then how do we stop it? I'm all ears.
[ 06:45:29 ] - [TD Leader] MatMix ツ: Well simple.. you contain the terrorists in one country with the permission of that country.. not just invading and dropping bombs.
[ 06:45:40 ] - [TD Leader] MatMix ツ: Look at Russia with Syria.. working with the intelligence. on the groun
[ 06:45:44 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: Have you ever tried reasoning with terrorists?
[ 06:45:47 ] - [TD Leader] MatMix ツ: that is how you do it.. to contain terrorists.
[ 06:45:52 ] - [TD Leader] MatMix ツ: Reason? I said contain..
[ 06:45:52 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: Have you tried sitting down at a table with terrorists?
[ 06:45:59 ] - [TD Leader] MatMix ツ: lock them into a corner where they cannot escape..
[ 06:46:00 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: So, using military force?
[ 06:46:02 ] - [PDF Soldier] Slayer: t\dd
[ 06:46:02 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: An invasion.
[ 06:46:10 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: They involve boots on the ground.
[ 06:46:14 ] - [PDF Soldier] Slayer: Mat terrorists want forceful action
[ 06:46:15 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: And then the idea will spread anyway.
[ 06:46:19 ] - [PDF Soldier] Slayer: its like a troll
[ 06:46:22 ] - [TD Leader] MatMix ツ: Let me tell you a little fact.
[ 06:46:24 ] - [PDF Soldier] Slayer: they want to be attacked
[ 06:46:29 ] - [PDF Soldier] Slayer: gives themn a reason to grow
[ 06:46:31 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: Hell, even if you use airstrikes, drone strikes, the idea will spread anyway.
[ 06:46:54 ] - [TD Leader] MatMix ツ: Your drone strikes hit 96% of non-targets. You create more terrorist than you eliminate. You have been doing this for years now.. knowing.
[ 06:47:00 ] - [TD Leader] MatMix ツ: You complain about terrorist.. look at your government.
[ 06:47:03 ] - [TD Leader] MatMix ツ: they help the creation of more.
[ 06:47:15 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: Mat, wait a second, back on the original topic of "how do we stop it...:
[ 06:47:20 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: How do you suggest we contain these guys?
[ 06:47:24 ] - [PDF Soldier] Slayer: mat please dont argue that point
[ 06:47:32 ] - [PDF Soldier] Slayer: uk has does its fair share of terrorists
[ 06:47:38 ] - [TD Leader] MatMix ツ: Simple.. work with the Syrian government. Not isolate them. You cannot attack people on the ground from above without intelligence.
[ 06:47:38 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: Without boots on the ground, Airstrikes and Drone Strikes are all we've got.
[ 06:47:47 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: The Syrian Government's leader is a tyrant!
[ 06:47:47 ] - [TD Leader] MatMix ツ: Russia has done more than America in couple months.. than America in 1 year.
[ 06:47:59 ] - [TD Leader] MatMix ツ: You failed to noticed oil trucks being taken into turkey threw the Syrian border.
[ 06:48:03 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: Russia is doing the exact same thing We're doing. Launching strikes.
[ 06:48:04 ] - [FlyStark] Neo: If it's so simple why hasn't anyone done it.
[ 06:48:12 ] - [TD Leader] MatMix ツ: You failed to reduced the size of them in Syrian but they grew bigger in fact.
[ 06:48:24 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: Russia isn't containing.
[ 06:48:25 ] - [TD Leader] MatMix ツ: Russia came along and in 2 months.. cut 50% of oil that made them over nearly 100million a month.
[ 06:48:28 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: ISIL is still growing.
[ 06:48:34 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: And those were US strikes

[ 06:49:17 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: It was, Slayer.
[ 06:49:22 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: Well done.
[ 06:49:27 ] - [TD Leader] MatMix ツ: No America.. no mentin of America in this. America did not want to take part becaus "Assad has to go"

[ 07:12:01 ] - [TD Leader] MatMix ツ: Every country can protect itself. No country has the right to dictate who can or who cannot have.
[ 07:12:09 ] - [TD Leader] MatMix ツ: When a country has nukes.. it cannot tell another country not to build missiles.
[ 07:12:10 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: Why not?

[ 07:13:01 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: When Iran has said that they WILL use a nuke against Israel if they had one, it's more than acceptable to make sure they don't ever have...
[ 07:13:04 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: that capability.

[ 11:22:11 ] - [PDF Leader] salar29: Indeed
[ 11:22:16 ] - [CMA] Condog: nonononononoononononono!
[ 11:22:19 ] - [FlyStark] Zero Grav: Autopilot doesn't work in turbulence.
[ 11:22:22 ] - [PDF Leader] salar29: It does
[ 11:22:25 ] - [PDF Crprl] \(ÒωÓ)/: your crane is next
[ 11:22:28 ] - Rph: i t can maintaing your pitch, speed, and many mroe
[ 11:22:29 ] - [CMA] Condog: no!
[ 11:22:30 ] - [PDF Leader] salar29: Set only the pitch and roll
[ 11:22:35 ] - [CMA] Condog: plz no
[ 11:22:38 ] - Bonnie the bunny: in this can you turn on auto pilot
[ 11:22:41 ] - [PDF Crprl] \(ÒωÓ)/: i'll wait for u to come and watch
[ 11:22:48 ] - [PDF Crprl] \(ÒωÓ)/:  as i destroy what you love most
[ 11:22:49 ] - [CMA] Condog: no dont do this !
[ 11:22:56 ] - Rph: well if you are planning to land you need to do it manually
[ 11:23:00 ] - [PDF Airman] Vqxn: are all planes affected by the turbulance or only light aircraft?
[ 11:23:01 ] - [CMA] Condog: let me be on it at least!
[ 11:23:03 ] - [PDF Leader] salar29: All
[ 11:23:14 ] - [PDF Airman] Vqxn: Cool Ima fly an aeroliner 
[ 11:23:26 ] - Rph: tally said he is adding some final stuff to my vehicle rain!
[ 11:23:26 ] - [FlyStark] Zero Grav: d
[ 11:23:33 ] - [PDF Leader] salar29: Lol
[ 11:23:35 ] - [FlyStark] Zero Grav: It's way too extreme.
[ 11:23:35 ] - [CMA] Condog: let me b eon it!
[ 11:23:38 ] - [PDF Airman] Vqxn: Vehicle raid? xD
[ 11:23:41 ] - [PDF Airman] Vqxn: Rain*
[ 11:23:44 ] - Rph: indeed
[ 11:23:47 ] - [PDF Soldier]mortonz: hi everyone im back earlier than i thought
[ 11:23:53 ] - [PDF Airman] Vqxn: hello
[ 11:23:56 ] - [FlyStark] Zero Grav: I have flown a Cessna 172 in extreme turbulence and it was crazy, but nothing like this.
[ 11:23:58 ] - Rph: you type in command and 10 or 5 vehicles fall to yer head
[ 11:24:00 ] - [PDF Leader] salar29: xD
[ 11:24:01 ] - [FlyStark] Zero Grav: This isn't how it acts.
[ 11:24:02 ] - [CMA] Condog: do it
[ 11:24:04 ] - [PDF Leader] salar29: 30KTS OMG
[ 11:24:06 ] - [PDF Crprl] \(ÒωÓ)/: i cant
[ 11:24:08 ] - Rph: then they dissapear
[ 11:24:10 ] - [PDF Airman] Vqxn: lol
[ 11:24:15 ] - [CMA] Condog: wha?
[ 11:24:26 ] - [PDF Crprl] \(ÒωÓ)/:  i already blew it up, you're hovering in mid air
[ 11:24:32 ] - Rph: Solid Kong that was great flight concidering conditions
[ 11:24:33 ] - [CMA] Condog: am i?
[ 11:24:37 ] - [CMA] Condog: lol!
[ 11:24:42 ] - Solid Kong: thanks
[ 11:24:47 ] - [CMA] Condog: no!
[ 11:24:52 ] - [CMA] Condog: nononono
[ 11:24:55 ] - [CMA] Condog: no!
[ 11:25:06 ] - [PDF Crprl] \(ÒωÓ)/: i just saw you losing hp for no reason
[ 11:25:08 ] - [PDF Crprl] \(ÒωÓ)/: then falling
[ 11:25:12 ] - [PDF Airman] Vqxn: Right IM going to Paya Luas in this storm :D
[ 11:25:25 ] - Rph: me too
[ 11:25:33 ] - [CMA] Condog: theres more
[ 11:25:33 ] - [FlyStark] Zero Grav: Hello Taha
[ 11:25:39 ] - Rph: i go to Paya in honda jet from dap2
[ 11:25:45 ] - [PDF Airman] Vqxn: xD
[ 11:25:46 ] - [PDF Leader] salar29: Wooo
[ 11:25:50 ] - [PDF Leader] salar29: Kinda hard landing
[ 11:25:53 ] - [PDF Leader] salar29: Wing striked
[ 11:25:56 ] - [PDF Airman] Vqxn: It barely affects Aeroliners
[ 11:25:58 ] - [PDF Leader] salar29: Strikes*
[ 11:26:12 ] - Rph: it barely affects any big planes*
[ 11:26:17 ] - [PDF Leader] salar29: True
[ 11:26:25 ] - Rph: that is why i am going in hondajet/silverbolt
[ 11:26:26 ] - [PDF Leader] salar29: But it still does at 30kts lol
[ 11:26:38 ] - [PDF Leader] salar29: Airhawk is even worse lol
[ 11:26:43 ] - [PDF Airman] Vqxn: Ill fly in a hondajet back to pia
[ 11:26:45 ] - [CMA] Condog: ys he left!
[ 11:26:46 ] - Rph: okay i go in airhawk
[ 11:26:49 ] - [PDF Airman] Vqxn: Airhawk then :D
[ 11:26:59 ] - [PDF Leader] salar29: Airhawk is slow which makes it even harder
[ 11:27:08 ] - [PDF Leader] salar29: I just flew one
[ 11:27:15 ] - [PDF Leader] salar29: Hard landing tbh
[ 11:27:19 ] - Rph: this is hard. i loose course
[ 11:27:27 ] - [PDF Leader] salar29: Set zero pitch and roll
[ 11:27:48 ] - [CMA] Condog: oh god"!
[ 11:27:52 ] - [PDF Airman] Vqxn: hehe
[ 11:27:54 ] - [FlyStark] Zero Grav: Landing is challenging, and once you manage you feel proud.
[ 11:27:57 ] - [CMA] Condog: no!
[ 11:27:57 ] - [PDF Leader] salar29: Yep
[ 11:28:07 ] - [PDF Airman] Vqxn: just a reminder to everyone make sure u read the rules :3
[ 11:28:13 ] - [PDF Leader] salar29: But I love crosswind landings with the Aeroliner
[ 11:28:14 ] - Rph: me and my airhawk with ap :)
[ 11:28:14 ] - [PDF Cpl] \(ÒωÓ)/: if i cant touch your big crane
[ 11:28:16 ] - [PDF Cpl] \(ÒωÓ)/: no one can
[ 11:28:19 ] - [PDF Airman] Vqxn: PRess F7 if you dont know how
[ 11:28:21 ] - [PDF Leader] salar29: Lol
[ 11:28:22 ] - [PDF Leader] salar29: Omg
[ 11:28:28 ] - [PDF Leader] salar29: Make autopilot land by itself 
[ 11:28:31 ] - [PDF Leader] salar29: See if it can
[ 11:28:40 ] - [CMA] Condog: bye
[ 11:28:44 ] - Darth Vader: t
[ 11:28:48 ] - Rph: 30 knots!
[ 11:28:52 ] - [CMA] Condog: lololololo
[ 11:28:58 ] - [PDF Airman] Vqxn: 28
[ 11:29:05 ] - Darth Vader: t
[ 11:29:10 ] - [CMA] Condog: fly plane fly!
[ 11:29:28 ] - [FlyStark] Zero Grav: Zero pitch isn't flying straight, it's actually descending, the Airhawk, or most planes on JC2 fly at a noise high pitch at around 2 to 3deg
[ 11:29:53 ] - [FlyStark] Zero Grav: Of course in a real plane with the proper trim configeation you could fly at 0.
[ 11:30:03 ] - [CMA] Condog: OwO you cant shoot me down!
[ 11:30:25 ] - [CMA] Condog: why do i say these things
[ 11:30:35 ] - [PDF Airman] Vqxn: landed
[ 11:30:38 ] - [PDF Leader] salar29: Omg
[ 11:30:42 ] - [PDF Leader] salar29: Hondajet landed
[ 11:30:43 ] - [PDF Leader] salar29: Decently
[ 11:30:55 ] - [CMA] Condog: honda always spins out
[ 11:30:56 ] - [PDF Leader] salar29: Ugh the storm is out
[ 11:30:56 ] - Rph: airhawk en-route
[ 11:30:59 ] - [PDF Airman] Vqxn: Why do people say Hondajets are so hard to fly
[ 11:31:04 ] - Rph: not where am i
[ 11:31:05 ] - [PDF Leader] salar29: Not always if you go at a good speed, Condog
[ 11:31:09 ] - Rph: i still experience storm
[ 11:31:15 ] - [PDF Leader] salar29: Because they're pretty hard to land, VQ
[ 11:31:25 ] - [PDF Airman] Vqxn: Oh god this is hard
[ 11:31:27 ] - [PDF Airman] Vqxn: Airhawk
[ 11:31:28 ] - Rph: okay ill go to nearest ap
[ 11:31:32 ] - [PDF Leader] salar29: Hondajet in turbulence is EZ
[ 11:31:42 ] - Rph: landing airhawk with 30knots of wind on ap3
[ 11:31:44 ] - [PDF Airman] Vqxn: I still got it at Paya
[ 11:31:52 ] - [PDF Leader] salar29: That's EZ, Rph 
[ 11:31:56 ] - [PDF Airman] Vqxn: Flying out into tghe wind
[ 11:32:04 ] - [CMA] Condog: :|
[ 11:32:15 ] - [PDF Leader] salar29: Actually
[ 11:32:20 ] - [PDF Leader] salar29: Airhawk is pretty hard
[ 11:32:27 ] - Rph: landing succesful
[ 11:32:36 ] - [CMA] Condog: im off to me base
[ 11:32:42 ] - [FlyStark] Zero Grav: The HondaJet / Cassius is a pretty easy plane to master once you've leant the stall speed, good landing speed, rotate speed, etc. 
[ 11:32:48 ] - [PDF Leader] salar29: Yep
[ 11:32:52 ] - [CMA] Condog: all pdf is welcome
[ 11:32:56 ] - [PDF Leader] salar29: But the landing is still pretty hard 
[ 11:33:03 ] - [CMA] Condog: exept OwO
[ 11:33:10 ] - Rph: now takeoff and landing on second runaway
[ 11:33:10 ] - [CMA] Condog: yep 
[ 11:33:12 ] - [PDF Leader] salar29: If you don't have zero roll and under 130 speed
[ 11:33:18 ] - [CMA] Condog: thats why i haste you!
[ 11:33:20 ] - [CMA] Condog: hate
[ 11:33:26 ] - [PDF Airman] Vqxn: Omfg so much wingstrike
[ 11:33:31 ] - [PDF Leader] salar29: Flaring is super important for the HondaJet
[ 11:33:33 ] - [PDF Airman] Vqxn: Whats wrong Condog 
[ 11:33:39 ] - [CMA] Condog: OwO
[ 11:33:43 ] - [CMA] Condog: owo
[ 11:33:56 ] - [PDF Leader] salar29: Gonna fly a bering
[ 11:34:01 ] - [FlyStark] Zero Grav: If you flare correctly, spinning out is usaully caused by not flaring correctly / front wheel impact, and of course being too fast.
[ 11:34:03 ] - [PDF Airman] Vqxn: What about him
[ 11:34:06 ] - Darth Vader: ถ้าจะแอดตี้ทำไงหรอ
[ 11:34:07 ] - [PDF Leader] salar29: This thing won't feel a touch of turbulence
[ 11:34:10 ] - [PDF Leader] salar29: Yep, Zero
[ 11:34:11 ] - [PDF Airman] Vqxn: Bering arent affected by it
[ 11:34:12 ] - [CMA] Condog: called me condom 
[ 11:34:13 ] - [FlyStark] Zero Grav: incorrectly*
[ 11:34:26 ] - [CMA] Condog: and destroyed myu cranes!
[ 11:34:29 ] - [PDF Cpl] \(ÒωÓ)/: but i call Salar Salad and he loves me
[ 11:34:33 ] - [PDF Leader] salar29: Yeh
[ 11:34:35 ] - [PDF Leader] salar29: <3
[ 11:34:40 ] - [PDF Airman] Vqxn: [PDF Cpl] \(ÒωÓ)/  Dont insult players pls
[ 11:34:49 ] - [PDF Leader] salar29: VQ it's a joke bud
[ 11:34:59 ] - [CMA] Condog: no it not
[ 11:35:03 ] - [PDF Cpl] \(ÒωÓ)/: vq wants to test his ban hammer on me
[ 11:35:05 ] - [PDF Airman] Vqxn: he took great offense to it and is probably gonna kill himself
[ 11:35:05 ] - [PDF Cpl] \(ÒωÓ)/: i know it
[ 11:35:10 ] - [PDF Leader] salar29: Wut?
[ 11:35:19 ] - [PDF Leader] salar29: You kidding?
[ 11:35:22 ] - [PDF Airman] Vqxn: I cant ban owo
[ 11:35:41 ] - [PDF Cpl] \(ÒωÓ)/: cool, then i can do whatever i wantr!!
[ 11:35:44 ] - [PDF Leader] salar29: Nah, turbulence is nothing for the Bering
[ 11:35:45 ] - [CMA] Condog: but can warn him?
[ 11:35:50 ] - [PDF Airman] Vqxn: I did
[ 11:35:50 ] - [PDF Leader] salar29: OwO we can kick you <3
[ 11:36:10 ] - [PDF Cpl] \(ÒωÓ)/: for somew reason my plane keeps turning to the right
[ 11:36:16 ] - [PDF Cpl] \(ÒωÓ)/: is that turbulence ?
[ 11:36:18 ] - [PDF Airman] Vqxn: No
[ 11:36:22 ] - [PDF Leader] salar29: Ahhh
[ 11:36:24 ] - [PDF Airman] Vqxn: Its always happened
[ 11:36:25 ] - [CMA] Condog: you pressingd?
[ 11:36:25 ] - [PDF Leader] salar29: No more storm
[ 11:36:28 ] - [PDF Cpl] \(ÒωÓ)/: no
[ 11:36:33 ] - [PDF Airman] Vqxn: Use autopilot to stop it
[ 11:36:38 ] - [PDF Cpl] \(ÒωÓ)/: i'm steering left, and it slowly turns right
[ 11:36:50 ] - [CMA] Condog: lol
[ 11:36:51 ] - [FlyStark] Zero Grav: Good night everyone!
