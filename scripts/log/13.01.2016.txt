[ 10:24:33 ] - [FlyStark] Zero Grav: Until I think you are good enough.
[ 10:24:39 ] - [PDF Airman] xKamz: ...but...
[ 10:24:50 ] - [FlyStark] Zero Grav: And you can't fly without me inside the plane, until you have your first solo.

[ 10:26:18 ] - [PDF Airman] xKamz: Fuck no.
[ 10:26:27 ] - [PDF Airman] xKamz: I changed my mind, I no longer want to be a pilot.
[ 10:26:33 ] - [FlyStark] Zero Grav: Why?
[ 10:26:40 ] - [PDF Airman] xKamz: 7dick7 = piece of shit.
[ 10:26:56 ] - [FlyStark] Zero Grav: But once you have your first solo you can fly without me.
[ 10:27:05 ] - [PDF Airman] xKamz: When do I have my first solo?
[ 10:27:12 ] - [FlyStark] Zero Grav: When you are good enough.
[ 10:27:17 ] - [PDF Airman] xKamz: Oh god...
