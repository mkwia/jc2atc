[ 15:48:06 ] - Wham!: Do you know what AF447 just askin'
[ 15:48:50 ] - Myst: hi
[ 15:48:57 ] - Basil: Hello.
[ 15:49:01 ] - Ancient Demon: Hi
[ 15:49:09 ] - Myst: Anyone on teamspeak?
[ 15:49:10 ] - Wham!: Hello
[ 15:49:52 ] - Basil: I'm just casually eating rice crackers...
[ 15:49:59 ] - Basil: So damn tasty
[ 15:50:02 ] - Wham!: Okay
[ 15:50:28 ] - Wham!: The AF447 crash happened with A330 Airbus 
[ 15:50:39 ] - Wham!: It all was caused by freezed pitot tubes
[ 15:50:46 ] - Sir.Pineapple: And dumb pilots
[ 15:50:46 ] - Wham!: And due to the sidestick design 
[ 15:50:55 ] - Sir.Pineapple: the pitot tubes were functional when they stalled
[ 15:51:03 ] - Wham!: Stalling!
[ 15:51:03 ] - Basil: Also, any one want to beta test a new server in a minute/later?
[ 15:51:09 ] - Wham!: Recreating it right now
[ 15:51:15 ] - Wham!: Stalling currently above
[ 15:51:21 ] - Ancient Demon: wBasil what do you mean?
[ 15:51:24 ] - Wham!: Ocean
[ 15:51:26 ] - Myst: Basil what kind of server?
[ 15:51:28 ] - Basil: Something special
[ 15:51:30 ] - Basil: lol
[ 15:51:35 ] - Myst: rp?
[ 15:51:38 ] - Basil: Same as this
[ 15:51:39 ] - Basil: lol
[ 15:51:44 ] - Ancient Demon: ?
[ 15:51:48 ] - Basil: Same server, Just better performance, probalb
[ 15:51:54 ] - Basil: *probably
[ 15:51:56 ] - Wham!: Bonin
[ 15:52:04 ] - Myst: anymore plugins?
[ 15:52:12 ] - Basil: lol
[ 15:52:13 ] - Basil: no
[ 15:52:24 ] - Wham!: Give me the controls!
[ 15:52:28 ] - Wham!: 3 secs later
[ 15:53:16 ] - Wham!: The main reasons cause it crashed cause the captain did not see how the first officer moved his sidestick
[ 15:53:26 ] - Wham!: Sidesticks in Airbus are not synched 
[ 15:53:30 ] - Wham!: No synched movements
[ 15:53:41 ] - Sir.Pineapple: And the pilots were dumb
[ 15:53:43 ] - Wham!: But the yoke in Boeing's are synced
[ 15:53:49 ] - Myst: how do i come out off passive
[ 15:53:53 ] - Wham!: Myst type /pvp
[ 15:54:01 ] - Myst: thx
[ 15:54:16 ] - Wham!: Pilots seemed to not care about the stall warning too
[ 15:54:25 ] - Wham!: Didn't they get so slow that the stall warning stopped sounding
[ 15:54:45 ] - Sir.Pineapple: No
[ 15:54:49 ] - Wham!: Okay
[ 15:54:51 ] - Sir.Pineapple: I heard the blackbox
[ 15:55:22 ] - Wham!: The captain said "Give Me The Controls!" to Bonin a few seconds before crash
[ 15:55:24 ] - Sir.Pineapple: it has the alarm still working and the pilots had no coordination and didnt have a clue how to fly a plane without automation
[ 15:56:48 ] - Wham!: They did not know hand flying
[ 15:57:21 ] - Sir.Pineapple: yup
[ 15:59:04 ] - Wham!: How come they did not know hand flying
[ 15:59:21 ] - Sir.Pineapple: They go t used to automation
[ 15:59:27 ] - Wham!: How come
[ 15:59:34 ] - Wham!: Taking off then?
[ 15:59:43 ] - Sir.Pineapple: LIKE TODAYS PILOTS :/ thats why its good to also be a glider pilot, its in your blood
[ 16:00:02 ] - Wham!: If I ever become pilot in real life commercially
[ 16:00:17 ] - Wham!: I will hand fly at take off 
[ 16:00:20 ] - Sir.Pineapple: Yes but actually coordinationg in a storm or knowing that they can turn the ap back on in a few min since the pitot tubes unfreeze in 52secs
[ 16:00:27 ] - Wham!: Yes
[ 16:00:36 ] - Sir.Pineapple: thats just dumb
[ 16:00:36 ] - Wham!: This could have been avoided easily
[ 16:00:43 ] - Sir.Pineapple: it was pilot error
[ 16:01:10 ] - Sir.Pineapple: 3/4 of todays crashes are pilot error or deliberate acts
[ 16:01:50 ] - Wham!: GermanWings
[ 16:01:56 ] - Wham!: Deliberate Act
[ 16:02:14 ] - Sir.Pineapple: and MH17 and MH370 and Metrojet etc
[ 16:02:32 ] - Sir.Pineapple: terrible that its not the technology that harms us its our own selfish kind
[ 16:03:18 ] - Bit Master: да
[ 16:03:22 ] - Wham!: MH17 was missile
[ 16:03:30 ] - Sir.Pineapple: yup by russia
[ 16:03:34 ] - Sir.Pineapple: or ukraine
[ 16:03:34 ] - Ancient Demon: Bitmaster?

[ 19:34:27 ] - Rph: okay
[ 19:34:30 ] - Rph: no warning to both
[ 19:34:39 ] - Rph: warnings reset
[ 19:34:41 ] - [PDF Cpl] xKamz: Jimmy, the reason for that is because most PDF quit playing here.
[ 19:34:46 ] - [PDF Major] Archkey: Jimmy, its because PDF moved to another server, but also use this one too.
[ 19:34:47 ] - jimmyon3d: seriously, go fuck all PDF guys who just cry at every single instance
[ 19:34:49 ] - [PDF Cpl] xKamz: The PDF was 60% of this servers population.
[ 19:35:19 ] - jimmyon3d: you are in PVP mode. And you dont want to pvp. fuck logic xKamz
[ 19:35:26 ] - [PDF Cpl] xKamz: Read the rules.
[ 19:35:30 ] - [PDF Cpl] xKamz: Please.
[ 19:35:31 ] - [PDF Cpl] xKamz: Read them.
[ 19:35:32 ] - [PDF Cpl] xKamz: Rule 6.
[ 19:35:36 ] - [PDF Major] Archkey: Himmy, you obviously havent read the rules.
[ 19:35:39 ] - [PDF Major] Archkey: Jimmy*
[ 19:35:42 ] - [PDF Cpl] xKamz: Dumbass 10 year old. Sigh.
[ 19:36:06 ] - [PDF Major] Archkey: Kamz, what the fuck is that G9 doing there?
[ 19:36:14 ] - jimmyon3d: I have. And still in the weeks i play here xKamz I have yet to see ANYONE asking someone else for pvp
[ 19:36:16 ] - [PDF Cpl] xKamz: That is Jimmys RDM attempt vehicle.
[ 19:36:28 ] - [PDF Cpl] xKamz: Then that means no one wants to PvP.
[ 19:36:42 ] - jimmyon3d: the fuck it does
[ 19:36:43 ] - [PDF Cpl] xKamz: This is an ATC / Roleplay server.
[ 19:36:49 ] - [PDF Cpl] xKamz: That means it wasn't built for PvP.
[ 19:36:52 ] - jimmyon3d: nobody roleplays here
[ 19:36:55 ] - [PDF Major] Archkey: Jimmy, RDMing is not allowed, if you RDM one more time you will be hunted down by PDF until you surrender.
[ 19:36:57 ] - Rph: you are wrong
[ 19:36:58 ] - jimmyon3d: once a week for 20 minutes
[ 19:37:08 ] - jimmyon3d: go hunt me down
[ 19:37:09 ] - [PDF Cpl] xKamz: Jimmy, we were just PvPing...
[ 19:37:11 ] - jimmyon3d: i really dont care
[ 19:37:17 ] - [PDF Cpl] xKamz: Archkey, if you hunt him down, he gets what he wants.
[ 19:37:19 ] - Rph: i roleplay very often

[ 19:37:46 ] - [PDF Cpl] xKamz: I'm forming a News company (PBC) soon for RP.
[ 19:37:57 ] - [PDF Major] Archkey: Imma join Kamz.
[ 19:38:00 ] - jimmyon3d: In fact, whenever i said that exact sentence, someone from pdf would cry Archkey
[ 19:38:04 ] - [PDF Cpl] xKamz: I need ground units, pilots, and reporters.
[ 19:38:12 ] - Rph: i am reporter
[ 19:38:15 ] - [PDF Cpl] xKamz: ^
[ 19:38:23 ] - [PDF Cpl] xKamz: We should have teams.
[ 19:38:31 ] - [PDF Cpl] xKamz: Reporter + Pilot = Helicopter.
[ 19:38:43 ] - [PDF Major] Archkey: Jimmy, if you have a problem with this server press Esc and disconnect.
[ 19:38:44 ] - [PDF Cpl] xKamz: Like, Pilots just fly the helicopters, and reporters do the talking.
[ 19:39:05 ] - Ancient Demon: Jimmy seems like  hater
[ 19:39:07 ] - jimmyon3d: Archkey i liked this server before everyone wrote RDM every time they felt like it
