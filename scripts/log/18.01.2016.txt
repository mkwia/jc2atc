[ 23:24:16 ] - [PDF Soldier] Inte: ooh
[ 23:24:17 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: I think I'll be moving the PDF to another server.
[ 23:24:18 ] - creeperslayer637: wheee
[ 23:24:23 ] - [PDF sldr] Wanderer: Why?
[ 23:24:24 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: PVP is very easily fixed, so...
[ 23:24:24 ] - [FlyStark] Zero Grav: Why Walker?
[ 23:24:30 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: We're moving to a real life server of some sort.
[ 23:24:36 ] - [PDF sldr] Wanderer: oh
[ 23:24:41 ] - [PDF Soldier] Inte: with buymenu?
[ 23:24:52 ] - [PDF Soldier] Kirrim: were moving servers?
[ 23:24:52 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: Idk..
[ 23:24:59 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: More than likely, Kirrim.
[ 23:25:01 ] - [FlyStark] Zero Grav: That mean's Im going to be leaving PDF.
[ 23:25:06 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: Bye.
[ 23:25:32 ] - [PDF Soldier] Inte: also bear in mind I'm on my programming laptop so I might crash a lot (Running 64bit Ubuntu)
[ 23:25:44 ] - [PDF sldr] Wanderer: i'll miss this server
[ 23:26:00 ] - [PDF Soldier] Kirrim: you can still play on this server though
[ 23:26:00 ] - creeperslayer637: w8 what happenin to it
[ 23:26:00 ] - [PDF sldr] Wanderer: wrong person, Zero don't accept
[ 23:26:04 ] - creeperslayer637: i wasn wachin chat
[ 23:26:12 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: So will I.
[ 23:26:13 ] - [PDF Soldier] Inte: nothing happening to this server
[ 23:26:18 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: But we'll make a new server our home.
[ 23:26:21 ] - [PDF Soldier] Inte: I'm also still gonna come on here
[ 23:26:25 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: Yeah.
[ 23:26:29 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: Obviously, as will I.
[ 23:26:36 ] - [FlyStark] Zero Grav: Why?
[ 23:26:39 ] - [PDF sldr] Wanderer: cri cri
[ 23:26:46 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: Why are we moving, Zero?
[ 23:26:48 ] - [FlyStark] Zero Grav: All the best scripts are here.
[ 23:26:49 ] - [PDF Soldier] Inte: why still come here [FlyStark] Zero Grav ?
[ 23:26:55 ] - [PDF Soldier] Inte: oh
[ 23:26:57 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: True.
[ 23:26:58 ] - [PDF sldr] Wanderer: Yeah, the good WingSuit
[ 23:27:02 ] - [FlyStark] Zero Grav: And there are amazing features on this server you won't see on other servers.
[ 23:27:08 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: But there's no need for a "defence force" if there's no PvP
[ 23:27:11 ] - [PDF sldr] Wanderer: Where you can use Just Cause 3 physics
[ 23:27:17 ] - [FlyStark] Zero Grav: Like change of flight physics.
[ 23:27:21 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: True.
[ 23:27:48 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: But Grav, there's no need for a defence force if there's nothing to defend against.
[ 23:27:56 ] - [FlyStark] Zero Grav: Well.
[ 23:28:01 ] - [FlyStark] Zero Grav: There are still the RDMers.
[ 23:28:03 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: So we're going to be moving.
[ 23:28:12 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: But there aren't, Zero.
[ 23:28:13 ] - [FlyStark] Zero Grav: And there are the terroist groups.
[ 23:28:15 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: No PVP, no RDM.
[ 23:28:23 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: No PVP, no RDM. That's the fact.
[ 23:28:35 ] - [FlyStark] Zero Grav: Well isn't that a good think?
[ 23:28:39 ] - [FlyStark] Zero Grav: I've suffered too much.
[ 23:28:50 ] - Ritonsky: we can be 2 in boeing? 
[ 23:28:54 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: The second you put PVP on, you open yourself to any PVP
[ 23:29:02 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: Which means that there's no such thing as RDM.
[ 23:29:11 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: You're right, Zero. I'm not complaining.
[ 23:29:42 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: I feel as if the PDF has done it's job. We, alongside the moderators, have erradicated the problem of RDM.
[ 23:29:48 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: So, now we go to another server.
[ 23:29:51 ] - [PDF Soldier] Inte: RDM?
[ 23:29:54 ] - [PDF Soldier] Inte: rdm?
[ 23:29:58 ] - thore1234thore: Hi..
[ 23:30:00 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: RDM - Random Death Match.
[ 23:30:02 ] - [PDF Soldier] Inte: ahh

[ 23:30:16 ] - [PDF sldr] Wanderer: I'll miss the wingsuit
[ 23:30:21 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: We all will.
[ 23:30:24 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: But we're moving on.
[ 23:30:36 ] - [FlyStark] Zero Grav: So emotional :O
[ 23:30:40 ] - [PDF sldr] Wanderer: ;-;
[ 23:30:47 ] - [PDF Soldier] Kirrim: :'(

[ 23:31:41 ] - thore1234thore: Yes?
[ 23:31:43 ] - [FlyStark] Zero Grav: Does anybody need a flight or air taxi?
[ 23:31:47 ] - Ritonsky: we can be 2 in boeing?

[ 23:33:47 ] - [PDF Cpl] xKamz: Yo
[ 23:33:51 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: Kammie!
[ 23:33:59 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: So, I just made a big announcement.
[ 23:34:03 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: PDF is switching servers
[ 23:34:07 ] - [PDF Cpl] xKamz: Really?
[ 23:34:09 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: Yeah.
[ 23:34:12 ] - [PDF Cpl] xKamz: Why?
[ 23:34:14 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: Probably a real-life server.
[ 23:34:16 ] - [PDF Soldier] Kirrim: what server are we moving to?
[ 23:34:17 ] - [PDF Cpl] xKamz: Ah.
[ 23:34:21 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: Well, you're in passive mode right now.
[ 23:34:26 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: We're all automatically in passive mode.
[ 23:34:29 ] - [PDF Cpl] xKamz: So?
[ 23:34:36 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: That automatically disables PVP.
[ 23:34:46 ] - [PDF Soldier] Inte: No pvp = nothing to defend against
[ 23:34:50 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: I mean, it's so easy to turn off PVP, there's no need for a defence force.
[ 23:34:55 ] - [PDF Cpl] xKamz: Trust me, there's stil la shit load of PvP.
[ 23:34:59 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: Everyone is their own defence force.
[ 23:35:04 ] - thore1234thore: Can I join a faction??
[ 23:35:04 ] - [PDF Cpl] xKamz: Before I got off and you got on, we were in war.
[ 23:35:14 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: Yeah, there can be a shit load of PVP, but its so easy to turn it off.
[ 23:35:18 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: No need for us.
[ 23:35:30 ] - [PDF Cpl] xKamz: I just found this place though. ;-;
[ 23:35:36 ] - [PDF Cpl] xKamz: It's soooo nice.
[ 23:35:40 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: Kamz, what's your favorite Real Life server?
[ 23:35:42 ] - [PDF Soldier] Inte: Kamz
[ 23:35:48 ] - [PDF Cpl] xKamz: I was on some epic one.
[ 23:35:54 ] - [PDF Soldier] Inte: noone is saying you can't come here anymore
[ 23:36:00 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: Exactly.
[ 23:36:02 ] - [PDF Cpl] xKamz: Fallen Civilizan.
[ 23:36:09 ] - [PDF Cpl] xKamz: Zero!
[ 23:36:18 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: Alright.
[ 23:36:21 ] - [PDF Cpl] xKamz: Controller quit working. :/
[ 23:36:32 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: After I'm done attacking bot planes, why don't we check it out, Kamz?
[ 23:36:37 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: Go on a scouting mission.
[ 23:36:40 ] - thore1234thore: Not new to this game but never figured this out. When you have to thingd conneted how do you make them collide? Is that only just cause 3
[ 23:36:46 ] - [PDF Cpl] xKamz: I doubt it's what you think it is.
[ 23:36:54 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: Probably isn't.
[ 23:36:57 ] - [PDF Soldier] Inte: only JC3 thore1234thore 
[ 23:36:58 ] - [PDF Cpl] xKamz: You start with nothing but a hand gun, and search for crates with loot.
[ 23:37:05 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: Which is why I want you to show me around.
[ 23:37:06 ] - [FlyStark] Zero Grav: Kamz.
[ 23:37:07 ] - thore1234thore: Damn. Thanks though
[ 23:37:08 ] - [PDF Cpl] xKamz: Yes?

[ 23:37:44 ] - [PDF Cpl] xKamz: I love this place.
[ 23:37:47 ] - [PDF Cpl] xKamz: Even has an airstrip.
[ 23:37:58 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: If any PDF spots a bot plane, shoot it down. They're suicidal, and will crash in to other planes at will
[ 23:38:02 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: That's an order.
[ 23:38:07 ] - [FlyStark] Zero Grav: Kamz, please find an airstrip I haven't found.
[ 23:38:13 ] - [PDF Cpl] xKamz: 7dick7's always kill me. ;-;
