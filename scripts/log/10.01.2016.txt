[ 01:16:59 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: We're not really a nation as we have no true government.
[ 01:17:01 ] - [blue airlines} wolf: xkamz

[ 01:17:54 ] - xKamz: Ahhh, I see.
[ 01:17:56 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: Kamz, the land that you're in now belongs to a country known as Selatan.
[ 01:18:02 ] - xKamz: I know.
[ 01:18:06 ] - xKamz: We're just passing through with subs.
[ 01:18:06 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: That's an official country with an official government.
[ 01:18:09 ] - ArchkeyThePenguin: Going to shallow water...
[ 01:18:14 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: We protect them.
[ 01:18:33 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: The PDF is a 26+ member Military Force.
[ 01:18:36 ] - xKamz: I have one more question.
[ 01:18:39 ] - [blue airlines} wolf: what is the name of the sub\
[ 01:18:41 ] - xKamz: Yeah, the PDF is huge.

[ 01:19:17 ] - xKamz: Hard to explain?
[ 01:19:26 ] - ArchkeyThePenguin: Alright.
[ 01:19:27 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: We don't own airports in Selatan.
[ 01:19:32 ] - xKamz: Who does?
[ 01:19:33 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: That's not our territory.
[ 01:19:36 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: Selatan does.
[ 01:19:44 ] - xKamz: This isn't Selatan.
[ 01:19:56 ] - xKamz: Between the mountains and Pelaut Archipelago.
[ 01:19:57 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: Oh. That one.
[ 01:20:00 ] - xKamz: Yeah.
[ 01:20:03 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: That one's neutral.
[ 01:20:08 ] - xKamz: So no one owns it?
[ 01:20:13 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: Nobody owns it.
[ 01:20:18 ] - xKamz: Then I'm going to claim it.
[ 01:20:21 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: Pelaut Archipelago is disputed territory.
[ 01:20:25 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: You're entering a fuckfest.
[ 01:20:30 ] - xKamz: How so? xD
[ 01:20:39 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: Several factions want it.
[ 01:20:46 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: The mountianous areas and the PBC.
[ 01:20:53 ] - xKamz: Hmm. I'll claim it until it becomes a problem.
[ 01:20:56 ] - [blue airlines} wolf: get in
[ 01:20:59 ] - xKamz: If it becomes a huge problem, I'll let it go.
[ 01:20:59 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: The PDF has had to step in numerous times to prevent war breaking out.
[ 01:21:07 ] - xKamz: I just need various airports throughout the map for my intentions.

[ 01:21:50 ] - xKamz: Imagine like 20+.
[ 01:21:53 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: Trolls like that is the reason we exist.

[ 01:23:04 ] - xKamz: I plan on making a map soon.
[ 01:23:10 ] - xKamz: Labeling what's claimed and what isn't.
[ 01:23:18 ] - xKamz: What do you mean dissolved?
[ 01:23:48 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: He and his country dissolved.

[ 01:25:47 ] - [blue airlines} wolf: what
[ 01:25:57 ] - xKamz: All I want for my Faction are a shit load of airports.

[ 01:33:26 ] - PerplePapaya: just a prank broa
[ 01:33:30 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: That is a strategically important territory to the PDF.
[ 01:33:31 ] - xKamz: Ahh, alright.
[ 01:33:37 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: It is, however, open to the public.
[ 01:33:40 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: Go at your own risk.
[ 01:33:47 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: The island hasn't been completely secured yet.
[ 01:33:47 ] - Vadex: What about the mile high club?
[ 01:33:54 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: MHC is our main base.

[ 01:36:06 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: Most RP is at PIA - Panau International Airport.
[ 01:36:29 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: Try not to troll, and don't PVP unless the other person consents or unless you're engaged first.
[ 01:36:34 ] - xKamz: I don't think it'd be a good idea to claim the Airports through the mountains.
[ 01:36:49 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: Mountians are a fuckfest, Kamz.

[ 01:37:02 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: Every once and a while, a group of russians come on.
[ 01:37:04 ] - xKamz: What Factions / Nations are there atm?
[ 01:37:12 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: They RDM anyone they see.

[ 01:38:21 ] - Vadex: Lost is a good place to own
[ 01:38:21 ] - xKamz: Who'd you say owns the Pelaut Archipelago?
[ 01:38:28 ] - xKamz: LOST is already claimed by PDF.
[ 01:38:28 ] - Vadex: Cause of the EMP
[ 01:38:39 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: Pelaut is PDF.
[ 01:38:42 ] - xKamz: Ahh.
[ 01:38:48 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: As is Lost Island.
[ 01:38:52 ] - xKamz: I'm sure that gets attacked a lot.
[ 01:38:57 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: Pelaut?
[ 01:39:00 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: Not really.
[ 01:39:01 ] - xKamz: Lost.
[ 01:39:06 ] - xKamz: Not Pelaut.
[ 01:39:06 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: Lost is a fuckfest.
[ 01:39:09 ] - xKamz: xD

[ 01:39:15 ] - ArchkeyThePenguin: Meant to fix it. :P
[ 01:39:26 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: We have this group called the "Potato Kings" that claimed it as their own.
[ 01:39:37 ] - xKamz: We'll help fight against them if we see them on.
[ 01:39:38 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: We literially fight a minor war with them every fucking time.
[ 01:39:48 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: Is this an alliance, Kam?
[ 01:39:53 ] - ArchkeyThePenguin: Nailed it.
[ 01:39:58 ] - xKamz: It is if you want it to be.
[ 01:40:00 ] - You need Jesus.: what do i do after landing
[ 01:40:07 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: Sure.
[ 01:40:14 ] - xKamz: I'd rather have allies than enemies.
[ 01:40:34 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: Like your style..
[ 01:40:52 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: Lmao!
[ 01:40:52 ] - [blue airlines} wolf: dumb ass
[ 01:40:54 ] - You need Jesus.: how do  fill fuels
[ 01:41:06 ] - xKamz: I'm going to attempt to claim the airports throughout the mountains if I'm able to.
[ 01:41:17 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: We'll support you there, Kamz.
[ 01:41:20 ] - ArchkeyThePenguin: Ow...
[ 01:41:23 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: The more stable the mountians are, the better.
[ 01:41:31 ] - xKamz: Alright, then we should be good with airports.
[ 01:41:34 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: What is your faction's name, Kamz?
[ 01:41:39 ] - ArchkeyThePenguin: Land the heli real quick.
[ 01:41:43 ] - xKamz: We don't have one yet. I've been trying to come up with one
[ 01:41:54 ] - [blue airlines} wolf: lakeside is stupied
[ 01:42:09 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: Kamz, would you be willing to become a division of the PDF? You seem to share our ideals.
[ 01:42:14 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: Rather have friends than enemies.
[ 01:43:01 ] - xKamz: That could work out.
[ 01:43:20 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: Since you seem to have a like for Air Bases, would you like to join our Air Force?
[ 01:43:28 ] - Djeison Silva: como abastece?
[ 01:43:35 ] - xKamz: Would our claims go into your Faction?
[ 01:43:51 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: That'd be up to you.
[ 01:43:59 ] - lakesidekid: hi
[ 01:44:01 ] - xKamz: I'd prefer to take my claims with me.
[ 01:44:01 ] - PerplePapaya: how do i make a faction
[ 01:44:02 ] - [blue airlines} wolf: im on lost
[ 01:44:26 ] - xKamz: There's 3 airports throughout the mountains right?
[ 01:44:30 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: Understood, Kamz.
[ 01:44:44 ] - ArchkeyThePenguin: I know where one is.
[ 01:44:45 ] - xKamz: Would all of the airports be property of PDF?
[ 01:45:02 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: If you were to join our Air Force, we'd share them.
[ 01:45:32 ] - xKamz: That could work out great.
[ 01:45:41 ] - xKamz: How many airports are there throughout the mountains?
[ 01:46:06 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: The PDF is now claiming Lembah Delima as our newest military airport, and base.
[ 01:46:20 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: This military airbase will oversee and secure Airport 3.
[ 01:46:20 ] - xKamz: Where's that at?
[ 01:46:31 ] - Vadex: Wait can you land quickly?
[ 01:46:37 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: Southern East Tanah Raya.
[ 01:46:54 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: We also own PAN MILSAT.
[ 01:47:06 ] - ArchkeyThePenguin: Stop by for a cup of hot cocoa...
[ 01:47:15 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: We also own Pan Milsat. That's our ground-forces stronghold, and that's our way of keeping the mountians secure.
[ 01:47:27 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: We're trying to secure a base in the western sections of the mountians, but...
[ 01:47:42 ] - xKamz: Ahhh, I found it.
[ 01:47:46 ] - [blue airlines} wolf: bye im going to bed
[ 01:47:53 ] - xKamz: Goodbye, Wolf.

[ 01:50:02 ] - PerplePapaya: TELL ME
[ 01:50:08 ] - xKamz: Are Banjaran Gundin, Kem Sungai Sejuk, and the palace claimed?
[ 01:50:15 ] - PerplePapaya: TeLl Me
[ 01:50:24 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: Kamz, what territory is this area in?
[ 01:50:39 ] - lakesidekid: hi
[ 01:50:45 ] - PerplePapaya: HOW
[ 01:50:46 ] - Djeison Silva: hi
[ 01:50:48 ] - PerplePapaya: how
[ 01:50:50 ] - PerplePapaya: do
[ 01:50:51 ] - PerplePapaya: i
[ 01:50:52 ] - xKamz: Kem Sungai Sejuk is an airport / military base between the two mountains towards the west.
[ 01:50:56 ] - PerplePapaya: make
[ 01:50:58 ] - PerplePapaya: a
[ 01:51:02 ] - PerplePapaya: faction
[ 01:51:07 ] - xKamz: Banjaran is on the north side of the top mountain.
[ 01:51:09 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: No. That's not claimed.
[ 01:51:12 ] - xKamz: And I can show you the palace.
[ 01:51:23 ] - xKamz: The palace isn't needed though.
[ 01:51:31 ] - lakesidekid: go go go
[ 01:51:32 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: The Airport in't claimed
[ 01:51:40 ] - xKamz: Alright, then I'm going to claim those.
[ 01:51:42 ] - Vadex: I'm gonna go base jumping later
[ 01:51:48 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: So, I'd really like you guys to join the PDF as a division.
[ 01:51:51 ] - xKamz: I'm not going to claim the entire desert island.
[ 01:51:57 ] - lakesidekid: op
[ 01:52:04 ] - lakesidekid: stop
[ 01:52:07 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: Your appreciation of air power has my attention.
[ 01:52:18 ] - xKamz: I think joining the PDF as a division would give us a jumpstart.
[ 01:52:31 ] - xKamz: I want my Faction to be an air based Faction.
[ 01:52:35 ] - lakesidekid: come down
[ 01:52:42 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: Does this mean that you'd leave us sooner than later?
[ 01:52:47 ] - xKamz: Nah.
[ 01:52:48 ] - xKamz: We'd stay.
[ 01:53:03 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: There's one major thing that you'd have to agree to.
[ 01:53:16 ] - xKamz: And what is that?
[ 01:53:21 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: Do you understand the phrase "Never shoot first, shoot last."?
[ 01:54:25 ] - xKamz: What do you mean by that?
[ 01:54:28 ] - xKamz: That can mean many things.
[ 01:54:31 ] - PerplePapaya: can i join PDF
[ 01:54:40 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: To the PDF, it means that you never fire the first shot
[ 01:54:48 ] - xKamz: That's what I thought.
[ 01:54:51 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: It means that you must never be the aggressor. Never start a war for no meaning.
[ 01:54:58 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: However, if you're engaged, you fight back, and you win.
[ 01:55:03 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: You fire the last shot, and you end the war.
[ 01:55:16 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: You make whoever engaged you regret - that they fired the first shot.
[ 01:55:27 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: Sure, Perple. You may join the PDF. There are 2 steps to do so.
[ 01:55:32 ] - xKamz: Would the PDF be there to provide backup incase we're losing?
[ 01:55:43 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: Indeed, kamz.
[ 01:55:55 ] - xKamz: Then that'd work out great.
[ 01:55:55 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: We'd step in as a peacekeeping force.
[ 01:56:04 ] - xKamz: It'll keep my small Faction from being pushed around from the larger ones.
[ 01:56:38 ] - PerplePapaya: HOW IN FUCK DO I make MY OWN FACTIOn
[ 01:56:41 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: So, do you agree to being a division? As you can probably tell, I'm especially interested in having you join us.
[ 01:56:57 ] - PerplePapaya: HOW IN FUCK do i make MY own faction
[ 01:57:12 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: Just.... Do it.
[ 01:57:25 ] - xKamz: I agree. But do I to name our Faction or do we go under PDF title?

[ 02:09:50 ] - Fake Cheese: ill friend your mum on steam
[ 02:10:08 ] - xKamz: I was thinking... if my Faction took over various locations throughout the mountains, would that give us an advantage during a war?
[ 02:10:19 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: Um...
[ 02:10:36 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: Why don't you start taking over various locations when you're actually in a wartime state.
[ 02:10:37 ] - xKamz: We'd have a higher possibilty of being over run, but we'd cover more ground.
[ 02:11:01 ] - xKamz: True.
[ 02:11:46 ] - xKamz: What Factions are enemies of the PDF besides the Russians?
[ 02:13:02 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: Enemies of the PDF - Russians; Potatos
[ 02:13:10 ] - [PDF Major] Swofty-♣: There is PAP
[ 02:13:16 ] - [PDF Major] Swofty-♣: or there was

[ 02:14:23 ] - [PDF Major] Swofty-♣: It was but it could come back
[ 02:14:56 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: Don't plan on it.
[ 02:15:20 ] - Gaming Buffalo: danq
[ 02:15:25 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: Our interests are now in growing factions such as wannabe terrorist factions that wish to start random wars.
[ 02:15:43 ] - lakesidekid: sry

[ 02:15:53 ] - Gaming Buffalo: lol

[ 02:16:20 ] - lakesidekid: can i come
[ 02:16:22 ] - [PDF Major] Swofty-♣: Which would make the PDF bigger.
[ 02:16:32 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: Technically, yes.
[ 02:16:36 ] - xKamz: Is the PDF the strongest Faction?
[ 02:16:40 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: By far.
[ 02:16:47 ] - [-WA-]wolf2128: is there any way that i would be able to help you
[ 02:16:50 ] - PerplePapaya: hold on a min
[ 02:16:52 ] - [PDF Major] Swofty-♣: Pap was the strongest Terrorist
[ 02:16:54 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: Not to be cocky, but there is no other faction in this server that is as large as the PDF.
[ 02:17:01 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: PAP had a total of 4 members.
[ 02:17:09 ] - [PDF Major] Swofty-♣: Really?
[ 02:17:10 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: Our Steam group has a total of 26.
[ 02:17:17 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: We crushed them in 1 hour.
[ 02:17:25 ] - [-WA-]wolf2128: my steam group had 60
[ 02:17:27 ] - [PDF Major] Swofty-♣: Did they surrender?
[ 02:17:34 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: They dissolved.
[ 02:17:43 ] - [PDF Major] Swofty-♣: how?
[ 02:17:44 ] - [PDF Major] Swofty-♣: Why?
[ 02:17:45 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: Their members wanted to keep fighting, and their leader had enough.
[ 02:17:46 ] - [PDF Major] Swofty-♣: When..
[ 02:17:52 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: Their members left the leader, and fought on their own.
[ 02:17:57 ] - xKamz: Dary, are you part of my Faction?
[ 02:18:03 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: It was unorganized combat for them, and they fell like bricks.
[ 02:18:06 ] - [PDF Major] Swofty-♣: So Livewire didnt want to fight you anymore
[ 02:18:09 ] - [-WA-]wolf2128: where are you guys

[ 02:19:25 ] - [PDF Major] Swofty-♣: will he be apart of the PDF
[ 02:19:28 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: I'm trying to recruit him as a division of the PDF.

[ 02:20:52 ] - [PDF Major] Swofty-♣: Also yes
[ 02:20:55 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: Um, Kamz, it'd be much easier and more organized if you guys used the PDF tag.
[ 02:20:56 ] - [PDF Major] Swofty-♣: best base 2016
[ 02:21:02 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: That way, others would know that you're with us.

[ 15:31:22 ] - Xander Marshall: Yep.
[ 15:31:26 ] - Maikelele™:  how  u use autopilot?
[ 15:31:26 ] - [PDF Leader] salar29: It's good
[ 15:31:29 ] - ~ Hollsies ~: just tp back over to us i guess
[ 15:31:30 ] - Wham!: Take off manually as it's the most recommended
[ 15:31:33 ] - [PDF Leader] salar29: To use the pitch system
[ 15:31:36 ] - Wham!: Let me tell you a secret
[ 15:31:38 ] - ToxicFibre: Maikelele™ z
[ 15:31:40 ] - [PDF Leader] salar29: The smoothest are with autopilot
[ 15:31:54 ] - Xander Marshall: I'll meet you there
[ 15:31:55 ] - [PDF Leader] salar29: You set pitch 20, lock heading and cruise speed
[ 15:32:05 ] - Wham!: Yes
[ 15:32:07 ] - [PDF Leader] salar29: Then lower the pitch to 10 and then go to cruise altitude
[ 15:32:15 ] - [PDF Leader] salar29: Maikelele™ pls move
[ 15:32:18 ] - Wham!: 6 M/S Is Pitch 3 
[ 15:32:23 ] - [PDF Leader] salar29: Ok
[ 15:32:26 ] - Wham!: Maikelele™ Move your plane as we are taking off
[ 15:32:38 ] - Wham!: 1
[ 15:32:39 ] - Wham!: 2
[ 15:32:39 ] - Wham!: 3
[ 15:32:40 ] - [PDF Leader] salar29: M/s also depends on speed and roll
[ 15:32:43 ] - Wham!: Yes
[ 15:32:44 ] - ~ Hollsies ~: meet us where, xander?

[ 15:34:48 ] - Wham!: Salar 
[ 15:34:51 ] - [PDF Leader] salar29: Ok
[ 15:34:58 ] - Wham!: Let me tell you about descents and banking the same time
[ 15:35:08 ] - [PDF Leader] salar29: Slow down when banking?
[ 15:35:23 ] - Wham!: When you bank and descent you might lose alot of altitude of course it depends on your speed too.
[ 15:35:36 ] - ToxicFibre: Blake Belladonna™ dont ram plz
[ 15:35:39 ] - Wham!: The Aeroliner is very safe to handle at a V1 Cut
[ 15:35:42 ] - Maikelele™:  now iam far away from pia
[ 15:35:48 ] - Wham!: It can glide long enough to land again
[ 15:35:49 ] - [PDF Leader] salar29: Yeah, I tend to slow down to 300kmh to bank if the roll is 20º or more
[ 15:36:04 ] - Wham!: The Aeroliner is the plane with the longest gliding ratio in JC2
[ 15:36:07 ] - ToxicFibre: 2nd warning
[ 15:36:09 ] - [PDF Leader] salar29: The aeroliner is the easiest plane to takeoff and land
[ 15:36:12 ] - Maikelele™:  i was do nothing only be on top of the plane
[ 15:36:13 ] - Wham!: Yes
[ 15:36:13 ] - [PDF Leader] salar29: Imo
[ 15:36:29 ] - Wham!: Feel free to lock height with Autopilot Height Lock
[ 15:36:38 ] - [PDF Leader] salar29: Ascending to 1500
[ 15:36:56 ] - Wham!: Too much pitch
[ 15:37:00 ] - Wham!: Way too much
[ 15:37:03 ] - [PDF Leader] salar29: I hate the pitch of autopilot
[ 15:37:03 ] - Maikelele™: omg crazy ppl...
[ 15:37:13 ] - Wham!: Never ascend or descent with autopilot
[ 15:37:18 ] - [PDF Leader] salar29: True dat
[ 15:37:25 ] - Wham!: Fly to the desired height manually and then lock the height 
[ 15:37:30 ] - [PDF Leader] salar29: Or just use pitch system and not altitude
[ 15:37:34 ] - Wham!: Yes
[ 15:37:46 ] - [PDF Leader] salar29: Slowed down to 300
[ 15:37:50 ] - Wham!: The Aeroliner is 40 meters long
[ 15:37:56 ] - ToxicFibre: CanadianSniper™ dont ram 
[ 15:37:58 ] - [PDF Leader] salar29: Cool
[ 15:38:01 ] - CanadianSniper™: okay
[ 15:38:12 ] - CanadianSniper™: but my lights say not to ram
[ 15:38:38 ] - Wham!: The Aeroliner can glide from PIA at 2000 meters of height to Paya Luas with no fuel easily
[ 15:38:39 ] - [PDF Leader] salar29: Descending at -15º
[ 15:38:55 ] - Wham!: When passengers are in the plane it's not recommended to descent with -15
[ 15:38:58 ] - Wham!: 10 is okay
[ 15:39:12 ] - Wham!: As the Aeroliner is sensitive to pitches too sometimes.
[ 15:39:16 ] - [PDF Leader] salar29: True
[ 15:39:22 ] - Wham!: Salar type /local
[ 15:39:27 ] - ToxicFibre: Shinelord CSGOEgg.co dont steal peoples vehicles

[ 15:39:46 ] - Wham!: Type /local
[ 15:39:52 ] - Wham!: ;D
[ 15:40:14 ] - Wham!: The recommended landing speed for this plane is 170 KM/H
[ 15:40:23 ] - Darth Vader: take bike RWY 04
[ 15:40:29 ] - Wham!: Do not exceed -6 M/S during landing
[ 15:40:35 ] - Wham!: Try to land as smooth as possible
[ 15:40:39 ] - Wham!: At 170 KM/H
[ 15:40:43 ] - Wham!: At 170 KM/H of course
[ 15:40:58 ] - Wham!: The Aeroliner cruise speed is 325
[ 15:41:04 ] - Wham!: Salar type /local
[ 15:41:05 ] - CanadianSniper™: no permission to take off!!!
[ 15:41:19 ] - [PDF Leader] salar29: It's cause local doesnt work with G
[ 15:41:25 ] - Wham!: Oh
[ 15:41:28 ] - Wham!: Salar now
[ 15:41:30 ] - [PDF Leader] salar29: Cause it registers u as in the first place u were at
[ 15:41:45 ] - [PDF Leader] salar29: Decent landing
[ 15:41:47 ] - Wham!: Let's get off the plane and check it
[ 15:41:56 ] - Wham!: I will learn you some stuff too
[ 15:42:04 ] - [PDF Leader] salar29: It's a bit damaged because of the other guy
[ 15:42:20 ] - Wham!: The winglets in the airplane makes it even better to fly
[ 15:42:33 ] - Wham!: Salar come
[ 15:42:38 ] - [PDF Leader] salar29: Well, it makes it easier to turn well
[ 15:42:48 ] - [PDF Leader] salar29: And adds lift if I'm not mistaken
[ 15:43:00 ] - Wham!: Yes
[ 15:43:02 ] - Wham!: It does
[ 15:43:08 ] - Wham!: These engines are very strong
[ 15:43:11 ] - Wham!: For The Aeroliner
[ 15:43:22 ] - [PDF Leader] salar29: Decent, could be stronger though :(
[ 15:43:30 ] - [PDF Leader] salar29: 325 is slow IMO
[ 15:43:36 ] - Wham!: Yes In Real Life
[ 15:43:41 ] - [PDF Leader] salar29: I know
[ 15:43:47 ] - Wham!: Salar
[ 15:43:51 ] - [PDF Leader] salar29: Yes?
[ 15:44:19 ] - Wham!: The airspeed could show much higher in the PFD inside the cockpit if the pitot tubes are freezed
[ 15:44:32 ] - Wham!: That caused the Air France crash
[ 15:44:35 ] - [PDF Leader] salar29: Pitol?
[ 15:44:38 ] - Wham!: Pitot
[ 15:44:40 ] - [PDF Leader] salar29: pitot?
[ 15:44:41 ] - Wham!: Yesd
[ 15:44:54 ] - Wham!: That made them think that they have a too high speed
[ 15:45:01 ] - Wham!: But they were actually normal
[ 15:45:09 ] - [PDF Leader] salar29: Oh right
[ 15:45:09 ] - Wham!: Which caused them to slow down until they stall
[ 15:45:16 ] - [PDF Leader] salar29: True
[ 15:45:24 ] - Wham!: So that's why the pitot tubes need to be unfreezed  and perfect
[ 15:45:32 ] - Wham!: Let's get in
[ 15:45:44 ] - Wham!: I am in
[ 15:45:49 ] - [PDF Leader] salar29: Ok, where to?
[ 15:45:52 ] - Wham!: To PIA

[ 15:47:38 ] - Wham!: Salar during V1 Cut in the Aeroliner try to fly it and turn it to left or right to land at the runway again
[ 15:47:55 ] - Wham!: It's the safest to glide with
[ 15:47:56 ] - [PDF Leader] salar29: So like take off and go around and land?
[ 15:48:00 ] - Wham!: Yes
[ 15:48:00 ] - ToxicFibre: CanadianSniper™ dont ram 2nd warning

[ 17:29:37 ] - [PDF Airman] xKamz: Meaning if your target also wants to PvP then you can start.
[ 17:29:40 ] - jimmyon3d: yeah so where to draw the line?
[ 17:29:53 ] - [PDF Airman] xKamz: But don't fire upon a random player.
[ 17:29:53 ] - ~ Hollsies ~: When someone wants to but the other doesn't, that's where the line is
[ 17:29:55 ] - Abstract17: When you do it wothout consent
[ 17:30:08 ] - Abstract17: A very  simple line
[ 17:30:54 ] - ~ Hollsies ~: A very simple line, but some people purposely ignore it

[ 17:31:07 ] - jimmyon3d: i shoot back and he got a screenshot to ban me

[ 17:31:31 ] - ~ Hollsies ~: oh

[ 17:32:17 ] - jimmyon3d: but the pvp in pvp zone is really nothing anyone not being passive should be complaining, unless its real grief
[ 17:32:26 ] - jimmyon3d: complaining about 1 kill really seems far fetched
