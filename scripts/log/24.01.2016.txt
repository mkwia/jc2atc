[ 12:36:55 ] - salar29: Man, I have such low cruise altitudes
[ 12:37:04 ] - salar29: I dunno why you guys go all the way up to 4km
[ 12:38:11 ] - Wham!: Let's start descent
[ 12:38:19 ] - jimmyon3d: slow and steady
[ 12:38:24 ] - jimmyon3d: watch out for sidewinds

[ 12:40:49 ] - salar29: :(
[ 12:40:51 ] - jimmyon3d: Flying over mountains is dangerous in a small Cassius salar. Strong dropwinds.
[ 12:41:13 ] - salar29: I guess, what's the turbulence speed?
[ 12:41:16 ] - salar29: Wind speed*
[ 12:41:20 ] - Wham!: I have turbulence off for this flight
[ 12:41:29 ] - jimmyon3d: you shouldnt have
[ 12:41:35 ] - Wham!: Simulating it instead
[ 12:41:35 ] - salar29: Then you shoulda gone over the mountains
[ 12:42:16 ] - jimmyon3d: Destination in sight!
[ 12:42:42 ] - jimmyon3d: Watch out for bird flocks! Very dangerous around here!
[ 12:43:11 ] - salar29: Ok back

[ 12:45:42 ] - jimmyon3d: I'd be dead now
[ 12:45:43 ] - Wham!: And plane spot each other
[ 12:45:51 ] - salar29: Hmmm that's cool
[ 12:45:56 ] - Wham!: Let's plane spot eachother take off and land at paya luas
[ 12:46:02 ] - salar29: That's pretty cool
[ 12:46:07 ] - Wham!: Let's do it
[ 12:46:08 ] - salar29: Lemme take off then
[ 12:46:09 ] - Wham!: Salar first 
[ 12:46:15 ] - Wham!: Land at north side of this runway
[ 12:46:25 ] - salar29: Jimmy can you clear the way?
[ 12:46:34 ] - jimmyon3d: yeah
[ 12:46:37 ] - Wham!: Land at north side of this runway Salar

[ 12:47:52 ] - jimmyon3d: weak radar :D
[ 12:47:55 ] - salar29: Wham! I might land at Runway 27 instead of Runway 18
[ 12:47:57 ] - Wham!: Yes it's from Jimmy and Salar
[ 12:48:09 ] - Wham!: Salar that's okay but from the right side
[ 12:48:14 ] - salar29: Yes
[ 12:48:27 ] - Wham!: I can hear Salar and jimmys plane but very distant and out of radar
[ 12:48:32 ] - Wham!: It sounds like wind but is the engines
[ 12:48:35 ] - salar29: On final
[ 12:48:43 ] - jimmyon3d: touchdown
[ 12:48:46 ] - salar29: No

[ 12:49:25 ] - Wham!: May I try and land now
[ 12:49:28 ] - salar29: Sure
[ 12:49:34 ] - salar29: Cassius or Aeroliner?
[ 12:49:37 ] - Wham!: Salar you plane spot  this time
[ 12:49:38 ] - jimmyon3d: aero
[ 12:49:40 ] - salar29: Ok
[ 12:49:44 ] - Wham!: I use Cassius
[ 12:49:53 ] - Wham!: If that's okay
[ 12:50:02 ] - salar29: It's more fun to use Cassius because you can flare and it's smoother
[ 12:50:18 ] - Wham!: I will land at the right side of Runway 27
[ 12:50:29 ] - Wham!: I might land at runway N-S from the north side too
[ 12:50:33 ] - salar29: Runway 27 is the right side of Runway 2 I believe
[ 12:50:36 ] - Wham!: Come here to this

[ 12:50:56 ] - Wham!: I will land at 27
[ 12:50:57 ] - salar29: Then you don't need to say right side of 27
[ 12:50:59 ] - salar29: xD
[ 12:51:08 ] - Wham!: Right side of 27
[ 12:51:15 ] - jimmyon3d: t

[ 12:55:43 ] - Wham!: Salar I can hear your cassius even though it's very far away
[ 12:55:54 ] - Wham!: It sounds like the wind but it is not and is the engines

[ 18:57:43 ] - Jeremy Clarkson: do roll
[ 18:58:06 ] - Wham!: Jeremy Clarkson It now shows how many meters per second you ascend or descend now
[ 18:58:23 ] - Wham!: Depends on speed too
[ 18:58:31 ] - Jeremy Clarkson: hehehe
[ 18:58:42 ] - Wham!: Jeremy Clarkson From this distance and height shall we descend with -3 M/S to land
[ 18:58:47 ] - Jeremy Clarkson: must go full speed to acheive maximum gliding range
[ 18:58:51 ] - Wham!: Closer it's 6
[ 18:58:51 ] - salar29: Speed and pitch are what's needed for vertical speed
[ 18:58:55 ] - salar29: Hello Jeremy Clarkson
[ 18:58:59 ] - Jeremy Clarkson: hi salar
[ 18:59:10 ] - Wham!: Now it's 5 and 6 M/S to descend
[ 18:59:14 ] - salar29: What's your main server now?
[ 18:59:17 ] - Jeremy Clarkson: indeed
[ 18:59:25 ] - Jeremy Clarkson: i dunno
[ 18:59:37 ] - Jeremy Clarkson: i suppose panda's
[ 18:59:43 ] - salar29: From what I know you hate kiwi and tally?
[ 18:59:49 ] - Jeremy Clarkson: i help him a bit
[ 18:59:55 ] - salar29: In what way?
[ 18:59:56 ] - Wham!: Jeremy Clarkson I fell out
[ 19:00:01 ] - Jeremy Clarkson: so did i
[ 19:00:08 ] - Jeremy Clarkson: moderating
[ 19:00:11 ] - Wham!: Jeremy Clarkson Let's try the vertical speeds for runway 
[ 19:00:19 ] - salar29: Oh
[ 19:00:21 ] - Jeremy Clarkson: oh yay
[ 19:00:26 ] - Wham!: To land on the runway we need correct M/S
[ 19:00:31 ] - Jeremy Clarkson: he hates kiwi and tally
[ 19:00:36 ] - Jeremy Clarkson: panda i mean
[ 19:00:42 ] - salar29: Who is Panda?
[ 19:00:43 ] - Wham!: Factors: Height, Speed And Distance From Runway
[ 19:01:04 ] - Jeremy Clarkson: his reason for banning them when it comes up on the screen is "nope"
[ 19:01:12 ] - salar29: Lol
[ 19:01:17 ] - Jeremy Clarkson: he is a friend of mine
[ 19:01:38 ] - Jeremy Clarkson: who say i hate kiwi and panda?
[ 19:01:42 ] - Wham!: Jeremy Clarkson Do you agree being at 200 meters and 2 KM from runway gliding should be -3 M/S 
[ 19:01:49 ] - Wham!: Let's test
[ 19:01:49 ] - salar29: I understood wrong
[ 19:01:51 ] - Jeremy Clarkson: yes
[ 19:01:59 ] - Wham!: We are at 2.70
[ 19:01:59 ] - Jeremy Clarkson: it is logical
[ 19:02:11 ] - Wham!: Landing Speed 125
[ 19:02:16 ] - salar29: Hmmm
[ 19:02:18 ] - Wham!: Approach Speed 140 so yes -3 M/S would be good
[ 19:02:22 ] - Jeremy Clarkson: who told you this?
[ 19:02:36 ] - Jeremy Clarkson: keep her steady
[ 19:02:40 ] - salar29: I'd rather not say anything but isn't it pretty obvious?
[ 19:02:46 ] - Jeremy Clarkson: no
[ 19:02:53 ] - Jeremy Clarkson: walker?
[ 19:02:56 ] - Jeremy Clarkson: no
[ 19:02:57 ] - salar29: Lol no
[ 19:03:02 ] - Jeremy Clarkson: he knows nothing
[ 19:03:06 ] - salar29: Indeed
[ 19:03:13 ] - Jeremy Clarkson: lag
[ 19:03:19 ] - Wham!: At the end pitch should become -3 M/DS
[ 19:03:19 ] - salar29: No
[ 19:03:22 ] - Jeremy Clarkson: -4m/s
[ 19:03:26 ] - Wham!: *M/S
[ 19:03:31 ] - Jeremy Clarkson: tally&kiwi
[ 19:03:38 ] - salar29: Pitch isn't measured in mps Wham! 
[ 19:03:46 ] - salar29: Well it was tally but yeah
[ 19:03:50 ] - Wham!: We are testing vertical speed not pitch
[ 19:04:03 ] - Jeremy Clarkson: twhen did he arrive at this conclusion
[ 19:04:10 ] - Wham!: Jeremy Clarkson In our tests let's call VERTICAL SPEED as VSP
[ 19:04:15 ] - salar29: I understood wrong Jeremy Clarkson 
[ 19:04:17 ] - Jeremy Clarkson: yes
[ 19:04:20 ] - Jeremy Clarkson: xD
[ 19:04:23 ] - Wham!: At the end VSP -3 M/S
[ 19:04:32 ] - Jeremy Clarkson: it sounds cool
[ 19:04:47 ] - Jeremy Clarkson: i know why he said it
[ 19:04:59 ] - Wham!: VSP -3 M/S Changing To 6
[ 19:05:08 ] - Jeremy Clarkson: i refused to talk to him even with lag as a mediator
[ 19:05:14 ] - Jeremy Clarkson: rog.
[ 19:05:18 ] - Wham!: Who ?
[ 19:05:26 ] - Jeremy Clarkson: LAg
[ 19:05:28 ] - Wham!: -3

[ 19:05:55 ] - Wham!: Flying there
[ 19:05:56 ] - Jeremy Clarkson: touch and go
[ 19:06:13 ] - salar29: Wham! the approach speed for me is 125 and landing 115
[ 19:06:17 ] - Jeremy Clarkson: les miserables
[ 19:06:19 ] - salar29: On average
[ 19:06:28 ] - Jeremy Clarkson: ease it in
[ 19:06:32 ] - Wham!: Approach speed for me in HondaJet is 140 - 190 on approach and landing speed is 125 - 130
[ 19:06:35 ] - Wham!: On average
[ 19:06:45 ] - Jeremy Clarkson: no need for hard landing
[ 19:07:05 ] - Jeremy Clarkson: or trying to kill us
[ 19:07:12 ] - Wham!: Jeremy Clarkson Shall we do a -3 M/S one or -6 this time
[ 19:07:20 ] - Jeremy Clarkson: -3
[ 19:07:25 ] - Wham!: Okay
[ 19:07:28 ] - Jeremy Clarkson: is gentler
[ 19:07:31 ] - Wham!: Yes
[ 19:07:38 ] - Wham!: Jeremy Clarkson What shall our distance be when doing -3
[ 19:07:41 ] - Jeremy Clarkson: s'up reece
[ 19:07:44 ] - Wham!: We will approach at 140 KM/H
[ 19:07:44 ] - .::Reece::.: Hey
