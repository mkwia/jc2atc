[ 01:39:49 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: Zero, Archkey is a member of your Air Force.
[ 01:39:50 ] - [FlyStark] Zero Grav: You are mistaken.

[ 01:40:34 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: Arch, Zero, you're both starting from scratch right now.
[ 01:40:37 ] - [FlyStark] Zero Grav: There is only a airfield.
[ 01:40:40 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: Zero, let Arch tag along.
[ 01:40:49 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: He's a member of your, our, air force.
[ 01:40:53 ] - [PDF Airman] Archkey: If she can stop killing me....
[ 01:41:04 ] - [PDF Soldier] Darkso: Excuse me, dying.

[ 01:41:32 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: Zero?
[ 01:41:40 ] - [FlyStark] Zero Grav: Nope.
[ 01:41:48 ] - [FlyStark] Zero Grav: He's just being a real fucking douch about it.

[ 01:42:58 ] - [FlyStark] Zero Grav: Me!
[ 01:43:03 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: That's it, Grav.
[ 01:43:10 ] - [FlyStark] Zero Grav: Mmmmmh?
[ 01:43:11 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: I'm not dealing with this
[ 01:43:18 ] - [FlyStark] Zero Grav: No need to.
[ 01:43:22 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: Out.
[ 01:43:25 ] - [FlyStark] Zero Grav: Because I can deal with it myself.
[ 01:43:50 ] - [FlyStark] Zero Grav: Arckdick, you wanna see my fucking strips? You can see my fucking strips.
[ 01:43:56 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: Grav, enough
[ 01:44:01 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: Now you're messing with a PDF member

[ 01:44:19 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: Do not kill him
[ 01:44:31 ] - [FlyStark] Zero Grav: Did you just see what I wrote in chat?
[ 01:44:39 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: Just, don't kill him
[ 01:44:41 ] - [PDF Airman] Archkey: May I speak next? As the next "Witness" ?
[ 01:44:45 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: You're both being immature
[ 01:44:55 ] - [FlyStark] Zero Grav: Archdick, speak.
[ 01:45:04 ] - [PDF Airman] Archkey: Thank you.
[ 01:45:05 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: Zero, enough!
[ 01:45:21 ] - [FlyStark] Zero Grav: I can't call him "Archdick"..?
[ 01:45:32 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: No, Zero Balls, you can't call him archdick
[ 01:45:44 ] - [FlyStark] Zero Grav: Well you can't call me Zero Balls.
[ 01:45:49 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: Fine.
[ 01:45:52 ] - [PDF Airman] xKamz: Can I be nicknamed "Kumz"?
[ 01:45:54 ] - [PDF Airman] Archkey: So, Zero Grav was going to show Kamz a few secret airports and that shit when I asked to tag along.
[ 01:45:57 ] - [PDF Soldier] Darkso: xD
[ 01:46:00 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: This is sad that I have to come in here and do this.
[ 01:46:13 ] - [PDF Airman] Archkey: I was going to go follow them but Zero was like.
[ 01:46:19 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: Because of both of your immaturity
[ 01:46:26 ] - [PDF Airman] xKamz: Walker = Wanker, Archkey = Archdick, Zero = ZeroBalls.
[ 01:46:33 ] - [PDF Soldier] Darkso: Me?
[ 01:46:40 ] - [PDF Airman] xKamz: Hm.
[ 01:46:42 ] - [PDF Airman] xKamz: No idea xD
[ 01:46:44 ] - [FlyStark] Zero Grav: I like Darkso.
[ 01:46:49 ] - [PDF Airman] Archkey: "Dont follow us!" Like she was going to go - No, im done, im going to stfu. Im not arguing with someone on their period...
[ 01:46:51 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: Zero, I'm especially dissappointed in you. You have more experience in the PDF.
[ 01:46:52 ] - [FlyStark] Zero Grav: He's cool.
[ 01:47:02 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: Zero, why couldn't he follow you anyway?
[ 01:47:06 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: He's one of your airmen
[ 01:47:18 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: And if you don't like him, fuckin deal with it.
[ 01:47:33 ] - [FlyStark] Zero Grav: Because I don't want all these strips to go viral like in the past, they are kinda personal and I like to keep them there away from all the
[ 01:47:36 ] - [PDF Soldier] Darkso: Wait, can't you tell one of your airmen to 'shoo' you're off duty?>
[ 01:47:39 ] - [FlyStark] Zero Grav: other ATC server players.
[ 01:47:51 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: Then why are you showing them to Kamz?
[ 01:47:58 ] - [FlyStark] Zero Grav: Because he is a close friend.
[ 01:48:06 ] - [PDF Leader] Walker: And what makes you think that Kamz won't show other close friends?
