Server Files for the JC2ATC Server.

The JC2ATC server was an Air Traffic Control Roleplay & Simulation server on Just Cause 2. On the 24th January 2016, 1 year after it's creation, it was decided that the project would not continue. We make these files public in the hope that someone will want to continue the server's development.

The server's website was www.jc2atc.ovh
